    <p><persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>RUTH</forename> <surname>PRYNNE</surname></persName> came out of the <occupation>doctor</occupation>'s office pullthe fur tight round her throat. She felt faint. Taxi.

Oh I <orig>cant</orig> go home just yet. <said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"Driver go to the <placeName>Old <nationality>English</nationality> Tea Room</placeName> on <address><num type="ordinal" value="40">Fortieth</num> Street</address> please."</said> She opened her long green leather purse and looked in. <said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="false" direct="true">My God, only <measure type="currency">a dollar</measure> <measure type="currency">a quarter</measure> <measure type="currency">a nickel</measure> and <measure type="currency"><num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> pennies</measure>.</said> She kept her eyes on the figures flickering on the taximeter.

He was fatter and whiter than he used to be. He gave her a stagy hug and kissed her on the forehead. <said who="#BillyWaldron" aloud="true" direct="true">"How are you? Do tell me. . . .

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"I've just been having my throat X-rayed,"</said> she said with a giggle. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I feel like the wrath of God."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#BillyWaldron" aloud="true" direct="true">"What are you doing <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename> </persName>? I <orig>havent</orig> heard of you for ages."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"Put me down as a back number, hadn't you?"</said> She caught his words up fiercely.</p>

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"To tell the truth <persName ref="#BillyWaldron"><forename>Billy</forename></persName> I've had a terrible run of bad luck."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#BillyWaldron" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh I know everything is dead."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"I have an appointment to see <persName>Belasco</persName> next week. . . . Something may come of that."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Dont</orig> talk about it. . . . If I could only get my throat all right. . . . A thing like that wears you down."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#BillyWaldron" aloud="true" direct="true">"Remember the old days at the <orgName>Somerville Stock</orgName>?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#BillyWaldron" aloud="true" direct="true">"The last time I saw you <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename></persName> was in <title>The Butterfly on the Wheel</title> in <placeName><settlement type="city">Seattle</settlement></placeName>.

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why didn't you come back and see me?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#BillyWaldron" aloud="true" direct="true">"I was still angry at you I suppose. . . . It was my lowest moment. In the valley of shadow . . . melancholia . . . neurasthenia.

    <p><persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename></persName> poured herself a fresh cup of tea. She suddenly felt feverishly gay. <said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh but <persName ref="#BillyWaldron"><forename>Billy</forename></persName> <orig>havent</orig> you forgotten all that? . . . I was a foolish little girl then. . . . I was afraid that love or marriage or anything like that would interfere with my art, you understand. . . . I was so crazy to succeed."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#BillyWaldron" aloud="true" direct="true">"Would you do the same thing again?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"I wonder. . . ."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#BillyWaldron" aloud="true" direct="true">"How does it go? . . . The moving finger writes and having writ moves on . . ."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"Something about Nor all your tears wash out a word of it . . .

    <p><said who="#BillyWaldron" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename></persName> I wish you <orig>werent</orig> taking that X-ray treatment. . . .

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"That's nonsense <persName ref="#BillyWaldron"><forename>Billy</forename></persName>. . . .

    <p>Later, sitting in the uptown express in the subway, she still could feel his soft hand patting her gloved hand. <said who="#BillyWaldron" aloud="true" direct="true">"Good-by little girl, God bless you,"</said> he'd said huskily. He's gotten to be a ham <occupation>actor</occupation> if there ever was one, something was jeering inside her all the while. <said who="#BillyWaldron" aloud="true" direct="true">"Thank heavens you will never know."</said> . . . Then with a sweep of his broadbrimmed hat and a toss of his silky white hair, as if he were playing in <title><foreign xml:lang="fr"><roleName type="honorific">Monsieur</roleName> Beaucaire</foreign></title>, he had turned and walked off among the crowd up <address>Broadway</address>. <said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="false" direct="true">I may be down on my luck, but I'm not all ham inside the way he is. . . . Cancer he said</said>. She looked up and down the car at the joggling faces opposite her. <said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="false" direct="true">Of all those people <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> of them must have it. <num type="cardinal" value="4">Four</num> Out of Every <num type="cardinal" value="5">Five</num> Get . . . Silly, that's not cancer. Ex-lax, Nujol, O'Sullivan's. . . .</said> She put her hand to her throat. Her throat was terribly swollen, her throat throbbed feverishly. Maybe it was worse. It is something alive that grows in flesh, eats all your life, leaves you horrible, rotten. . . . The people opposite stared straight ahead of them, young men and young women, middleaged people, green faces in the dingy light, under the sourcolored advertisements. <said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="false" direct="true"><num type="cardinal" value="4">Four</num> Out of Every <num type="cardinal" value="5">Five</num>. . .</said> A trainload of jiggling corpses, nodding and swaying as the express roared shrilly towards <address><num type="ordinal" value="96">Ninetysixth</num> Street</address>. At <address>Ninetysixth</address> she had to change for the local.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName> sat on a bench on <address>Brooklyn Bridge</address> with the collar of his army overcoat turned up, running his eye down <title>Business Opportunities</title>. It was a muggy fog-choked afternoon; the bridge was dripping and aloof like an arbor in a dense garden of steamboatwhistles. <num type="cardinal" value="2">Two</num> <occupation>sailors</occupation> passed. <said aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Ze</orig> best joint I've been in since B.

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName>. . . . I thought I'd never get here."</said> A grayfaced girl in a red hat and gray rabbit coat sat down beside him.</p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Jez I'm sick <orig>o</orig> <orig>readin</orig> want ads."</said> He stretched out his arms and yawned letting the paper slip down his legs.</p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Maybe I am. . . .

He tapped her arm sharply. <said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello <persName ref="#Francie">Francie</persName>. . . . How's my lil girl?"</said></p>

    <p>They walked back towards <placeName><district>Manhattan</district></placeName>, the way she had come. Under them the <geogFeat>river</geogFeat> glinted through the mist. A big steamer drifted by slowly, lights already lit; over the edge of the walk they looked down the black smokestacks.</p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"Was it a boat as big as that you went overseas on <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName>?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Bigger 'n that."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"<distinct type="slang">Gee</distinct> I'd like to go."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertsonDutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'll take you over some time and show you all them places over there . . . I went to a lot of places that time I went A.W.O.L."</said></p>

    <p>In the L station they hesitated. <said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#Francie">Francie</persName> got any jack on you?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sure I got <measure type="currency">a dollar</measure>. . . . I ought to keep that for tomorrer though."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"I got to have <measure type="currency">a nickel</measure> to get down to the office in the mornin."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh Hell! <distinct type="swearing">Goddam</distinct> it I wish we could have some money."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"Got anything lined up yet?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Wouldn't I have told <orig>ye</orig> if I had?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"Come ahead I've got a half a dollar saved up in my room. I can take carfare outa that."</said> She changed the dollar and put <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> nickels into the turnstile. They sat down in a <address><num type="ordinal" value="3">Third</num> Avenue</address> train.</p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Say <persName><forename>Francie</forename></persName> will they let us dance in a khaki shirt?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why not <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName> it looks all right."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"I feel kinder fussed about it."</said></p>

    <p>The jazzband in the restaurant was playing Hindustan. It smelled of chop suey and <nationality>Chinese</nationality> sauce. They slipped into a booth. Slickhaired young men and little bobhaired girls were dancing hugged close. As they sat down they smiled into each other's eyes.</p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Jez I'm hungry."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"Are you <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName>?"</said></p>

    <p>He pushed forward his knees until they locked with hers. <said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"<distinct type="slang">Gee</distinct>you're a good kid,"</said> he said when he had finished his soup. <said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Honest I'll get a job this week. And then we'll get a nice room an get married an everything."</said></p>

    <p>When they got up to dance they were trembling so they could barely keep time to the music.</p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"<roleName type="honorific">Mister</roleName> . . . no dance without ploper dless . . ."</said> said a dapper Chinaman putting his hand on <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName>'s arm.</p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Waz he want?"</said> he growled dancing on.</p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"I guess it's the shirt, <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName>."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"The <distinct type="taboo">hell</distinct> it is."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm tired. I'd rather talk than dance anyway . . ."</said> They went back to their booth and their sliced pineapple for dessert.</p>

    <p>Afterwards they walked east along <address><num type="ordinal" value="14">Fourteenth</num></address>. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName> <orig>cant</orig> we go to your room?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh <orig>dont</orig> do that; we wouldn't ever get married then <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName>. . . . <distinct type="slang">Gee</distinct> though why didn't you tell me?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"I didn't want to worry you <persName ref="#Francie">Francie</persName>. . . . <num type="cardinal" value="6">Six</num> months out of work . . . Jez it's enough to drive a guy cookoo."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"But <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName> where can we go?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"We might go out that wharf. . . . I know a wharf."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's so cold."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"I couldn't get cold when you were with me kid."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Dont</orig> talk like that. . . I <orig>dont</orig> like it."</said></p>

    <p>They walked leaning together in the darkness up the muddy rutted riverside streets, between huge swelling gas-tanks, brokendown fences, long manywindowed warehouses. At a corner under a streetlamp a boy catcalled as they passed.</p>



    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'll poke your face in you little <distinct type="swearing">bastard</distinct>," <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName> let fly out of the corner of his mouth.</p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Dont</orig> answer him,"</said> <persName ref="#Francie">Francie</persName> whispered, <said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"or we'll have the whole gang down on us."</said></p>

    <p>They slipped through a little door in a tall fence above which crazy lumberpiles towered. They could smell the <geogFeat>river</geogFeat> and cedarwood and sawdust. They could hear the <geogFeat>river</geogFeat> lapping at the piles under their feet. <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName> drew her to him and pressed his mouth down on hers.</p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Hay <orig>dere</orig> <orig>dont</orig> you know you <orig>cant</orig> come out here at night disaway?"</said> a voice yapped at them. The <occupation>watchman</occupation> flashed a lantern in their eyes.</p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right keep your shirt on, we were just taking a little walk."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Some walk."</said></p>

    <p>They were dragging themselves down the street again with the black riverwind in their teeth.</p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Look out."</said> A <occupation>policeman</occupation> passed whistling softly to himself. They drew apart. <said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh <persName ref="#Francie">Francie</persName> they'll be takin us to the nuthouse if we keep this up. Let's go to your room."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"Landlady'll throw me out, that's all."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"I <orig>wont</orig> make any noise. . . . You got your key <distinct type="informal"><orig>aint</orig></distinct> ye?

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName> let's go home. . . . I <orig>dont</orig> care no more what happens."</said></p>

    <p>They walked up mudtracked stairs to the top floor of the tenement.</p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"Take off your shoes,"</said> she hissed in his ear as she slipped the key in the lock.</p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"I got holes in my stockings."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"That <orig>dont</orig> matter, silly. I'll see if it's all right. My room's way back past the kitchen so if they're all in bed they <orig>cant</orig> hear us."</said></p>

    <p>When she left him he could hear his heart beating. In <time dur-iso="PT1S">a second</time> she came back. He tiptoed after her down a creaky hall. A sound of snoring came through a door. There was a smell of cabbage and sleep in the hall. Once in her room she locked the door and put a chair against it under the knob. A triangle of ashen light came in from the street. <said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"Now for crissake keep still <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName>."</said> One shoe still in each hand he reached for her and hugged her. He lay beside her whispering on and on with his lips against her ear. <said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"And <persName ref="#Francie">Francie</persName> I'll make good, honest I will; I got to be a <occupation>sergeant</occupation> overseas till they busted me for goin A.W.O.L.

Jez <persName ref="#Francie">Francie</persName> you'd like it."</said></p>

    <p>They were walking to dinner through the snow. Big snowfeathers spun and spiraled about them mottling the glare of the streets with blue and pink and yellow, blotting perspectives.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> I hate to have you take that job. . . . You ought to keep on with your acting."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Is this the place?"</said> They stood before an unlighted basement door covered by a closemeshed grating. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Let's try."</said></p>



    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Did the bell ring?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"I think so."</said></p>

    <p>The inner door opened and a girl in a pink apron peered out at them. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"<foreign xml:lang="fr">Bon soir mademoiselle</foreign>."</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Ah . . . <foreign xml:lang="fr">bon soir monsieur 'dame</foreign>."</said> She ushered them into a foodsmelling gaslit hall hung with overcoats and hats and mufflers. Through a curtained door the restaurant blew in their faces a hot breath of bread and cocktails and frying butter and perfumes and lipsticks and clatter and jingling talk.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"I can smell absinthe,"</said> said <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName>. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Let's get terribly tight."</said></p>

    <p>He stood bulky at the end of the corridor beckoning to them.

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"No I <orig>cant</orig>,"</said> said <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> laughing. They were at a little marble table in the corner of the crowded kitchen. A girl was dishing out at a deal table in the center. <num type="cardinal" value="2">Two</num> cooks worked over the stove. The air was rich with sizzling fatty foodsmells. <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> hobbled back to them with <num type="cardinal" value="3">three</num> glasses on a small tray.

    <p><said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"<foreign xml:lang="fr">Salut</foreign>,"</said> he said, raising his glass. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"Absinthe cocktail, like they make it in <placeName><settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement></placeName>."</said></p>

    <p>When <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> limped away from their table silence came down between them like an asbestos curtain in a theater.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"He's a funny duck,"</said> said <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> forcing a laugh.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"He certainly is."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> let's have another cocktail."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I must get hold of him and get some stories about <occupation>bootleggers</occupation> out of him."</said></p>

    <p>When he stretched his legs out under the table he touched her feet. She drew them away. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> could feel his jaws chewing, they clanked so loud under his cheeks he thought <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> must hear them. She sat opposite him in a gray tailoredsuit, her neck curving up heartbreakingly from the ivory V left by the crisp frilled collar of her blouse, her head tilted under her tight gray hat, her lips made up; cutting up little pieces of meat and not eating them, not saying a word.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gosh . . . let's have another cocktail."</said> He felt paralyzed like in a nightmare; she was a porcelaine figure under a bellglass. A current of fresh snowrinsed air from somewhere eddied all of a sudden through the blurred packed jangling glare of the restaurant, cut the reek of food and drink and tobacco. For an instant he caught the smell of her hair. The cocktails burned in him. God I <orig>dont</orig> want to pass out.</p>

    <p>Sitting in the restaurant of the <placeName>Gare de Lyon</placeName>, side by side on the black leather bench. His cheek brushes hers when he reaches to put herring, butter, sardines, anchovies, sausage on her plate. They eat in a hurry, gobbling, giggling, gulp wine, start at every screech of an engine. . . .</p>

    <p>The train pulls out of <placeName><settlement type="city">Avignon</settlement></placeName>, they <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> awake, looking in each other's eyes in the compartment full of sleep-sodden snoring people. He lurches clambering over tangled legs, to smoke a cigarette at the end of the dim oscillating corridor. Diddledeump, going south, Diddledeump, going south, sing the wheels over the rails down the valley of the Rhone. Leaning in the window, smoking a broken cigarette, trying to smoke a crumbling cigarette, holding a finger over the torn place. Glubglub glubglub from the bushes, from the silverdripping poplars along the track.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"EUie, <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> there are nightingales singing along the track."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh I was asleep darling."</said> She gropes to him stumbling across the legs of sleepers. Side by side in the window in the lurching jiggling corridor.</p>

    <p>Deedledeump, going south. Gasp of nightingales along the track among the silverdripping poplars. The insane cloudy night of moonlight smells of gardens garlic rivers freshdunged field roses. Gasp of nightingales.</p>

    <p>Opposite him the <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Elliedoll</addName></persName> was speaking. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"He says the lobstersalad's all out. . . . <orig>Isnt</orig> that discouraging?"</said></p>

    <p>Suddenly he had his tongue. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gosh if that were the only thing."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"What do you mean?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why did we come back to this rotten town anyway?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"You've been burbling about how wonderful it was ever since we came back."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I know. I guess it's sour grapes. . . . I'm going to have another cocktail. . . . <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> for heaven's sake what's the matter with us?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"We're going to be sick if we keep this up I tell you."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well let's be sick. . . . Let's be good and sick."</said></p>



    <p>When they sit up in the great bed they can see across the harbor, can see the yards of a windjammer and a white sloop and a red and green toy tug and plainfaced houses opposite beyond a peacock stripe of water; when they lie down they can see gulls in the sky. At dusk dressing rockily, shakily stumbling through the mildewed corridors of the hotel out into streets noisy as a brass band, full of tambourine rattle, brassy shine, crystal glitter, honk and whir of motors. . . . Alone together in the dusk drinking sherry under a broad-leaved plane, alone together in the juggled particolored crowds like people invisible. And the spring night comes up over the sea terrible out of <placeName><bloc type="continent">Africa</block></placeName> and settles about them.</p>

    <p>They had finished their coffee. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> had drunk his very slowly as if some agony waited for him when he finished it.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I was afraid we'd find the <persName><surname>Barneys</surname></persName> here,"</said> said <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName>.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"You brought them here yourself <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName>. . . . And that dreadful woman insisted on talking babies with me all the evening. I hate talking babies."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gosh I wish we could go to a show."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"It would be too late anyway."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"And just spending money I <orig>havent</orig> got. . . . Lets have a cognac to top off with. I don't care if it ruins us."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"It probably will in more ways than one."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName>, here's to the breadwinner who's taken up the white man's burden."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Life's just temporary for that matter."</said></p>

    <p>The taxi drew up. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> paid him with his last <measure type="currency">dollar</measure>. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> had her key in the outside door. The street was a confusion of driving absintheblurred snow. The door of their apartment closed behind them. Chairs, tables, books, windowcurtains crowded about them bitter with the dust of yesterday, the day before, the day before that. Smells of diapers and coffeepots and typewriter oil and <nationality>Dutch</nationality> Cleanser oppressed them. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> put out the empty milkbottle and went to bed. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> kept walking nervously about the front room. His drunkenness ebbed away leaving him icily sober. In the empty chamber of his brain a doublefaced word clinked like a coin: Success Failure, Success Failure.</p>

    <p><said who="#AnnaCohen" aloud="true" direct="true">I'm just wild about <persName ref="#HarryGoldweiser"><forename><orig>Harree</orig></forename></persName></p>

    <p>she hums under her breath as she dances. It's a long hall with a band at <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> end, lit greenishly by <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> clusters of electric lights hanging among paper festoons in the center.

    <p><said who="#AnnaCohen" aloud="true" direct="true">"Quit that."</said> She holds him away from her.</p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Aw have a heart."</said></p>

    <p>She doesn't answer, dances with cold precision; she's sickeningly tired.</p>

    <p><said who="#AnnaCohen" aloud="true" direct="true">Me and my boyfriend</p>

    <p>My boyfriend and I</said></p>



    <p>An <nationality>Italian</nationality> breathes garlic in her face, a <occupation>marine sergeant</occupation>, a <nationality>Greek</nationality>, a blond young kid with pink cheeks, she gives him a smile; a drunken elderly man who tries to kiss her . . .

    <p>With nothing but a photograph</p>

    <p>To tell my troubles to . . .</p>

    <p><said who="#AnnaCohen" aloud="true" direct="true">"What time's it?"</said> she asks a broadchested wise guy. <said aloud="true" direct="true">"Time you an me was akwainted, sister. . . ."</said> She shakes her head. Suddenly the music bursts into <title>Auld Lang Syne</title>.

    <p>Glowworm trains shuttle in the gloaming through the foggy looms of spiderweb bridges, elevators soar and drop in their shafts, harbor lights wink.</p>

    <p>Like sap at the <num type="ordinal" value="1">first</num> frost at <time when="17:00:00"><num type="cardinal" value="5">five</num> o'clock</time> men and women begin to drain gradually out of the tall buildings downtown, grayfaced throngs flood subways and tubes, vanish underground.</p>

    <p>All night the great buildings stand quiet and empty, their <num type="cardinal" value="1000000">million</num> windows dark. Drooling light the ferries chew tracks across the lacquered harbor. At <time when="00:00:00">midnight</time> the fourfunneled express steamers slide into the dark out of their glary berths. <occupation>Bankers</occupation> blearyeyed from secret conferences hear the hooting of the tugs as they are let out of side doors by lightningbug <occupation>watchmen</occupation>; they settle grunting into the back seats of limousines, and are whisked uptown into the Forties, clinking streets of ginwhite whiskey-yellow ciderfizzling lights.</p>

    <p>Dougan was waiting in the outer office. He sidled up mysteriously. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well <persName ref="#JoeOKeefee"><forename>Joe</forename></persName>, how's things?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Pretty good,"</said> said <persName ref="#JoeOKeefee"><forename>Joe</forename></persName> puffing out his chest. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#GusMcNiel"><forename>Gus</forename></persName> tells me Tammany'll be right behind us in our drive for the bonus . . . planning a nation wide campaign.

Have one?"</said> With their cigars tilting up out of the corners of their mouths they walked briskly cockily across <placeName>City Hall square</placeName>. Opposite the old <placeName>City Hall</placeName> there was a scaffolding. <persName ref="#JoeOKeefee"><forename>Joe</forename></persName> pointed at it with his cigar. <said who="#JoeOKeefee" aloud="true" direct="true">"That there's the new statue of Civic Virtue the <occupation>mayor</occupation>'s havin set up."</said></p>

    <p>The steam of cooking wrenched at his knotted stomach as he passed <placeName>Child's</placeName>. Dawn was sifting fine gray dust over the black ironcast city. <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename> <surname>Robertson</surname></persName> despondently crossed <address>Union Square</address>, remembering <persName ref="#Francie">Francie</persName>'s warm bed, the spicy smell of her hair. He pushed his hands deep in his empty pockets. Not a red, and <persName ref="#Francie">Francie</persName> couldn't give him anything. He walked east past the hotel on <address><num type="ordinal" value="15">Fifteenth</num></address>. A colored man was sweeping off the steps. <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName> looked at him enviously; he's got a job. Milk wagons jingled by. On <address>Stuyvesant Square</address> a <occupation>milkman</occupation> brushed past him with a bottle in each hand. <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName> stuck out his jaw and talked tough. <said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Give us a swig <orig>o</orig> milk will yez?"</said> The <occupation>milkman</occupation> was a frail pinkfaced youngster. His blue eyes wilted. <said aloud="true" direct="true">"Sure go round behind the wagon, there's an open bottle under the seat. <orig>Dont</orig> let nobody see you drink it."</said> He drank it in deep gulps, sweet and soothing to his parched throat. Jez I ddin't need to talk rough like that. He waited until the boy came back. <said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Thankye</orig> buddy, that was mighty white."</said></p>

    <p>He walked into the chilly park and sat down on a bench. There was hoarfrost on the asphalt. He picked up a torn piece of pink evening newspaper. <floatingtext><measure type="currency"><num type="cardinal" value="500000">$500,000</num></measure> Holdup. <occupation>Bank Messenger</occupation> Robbed in <orgName>Wall Street</orgName> Rush Hour</floatingtext>.</p>

    <p>In the busiest part of the <time when="12:00:00">noon hour</time> <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> men held up Adolphus St. John, <occupation>a bank messenger</occupation> for the <orgName>Guarantee Trust Company</orgName>, and snatched from his hands a satchel containing <measure type="currency"><num type="cardinal" value="500000">a half a million</num> dollars</measure> in bills . . .</p>

    <p><persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName> felt his heart pounding as he read the column. He was cold all over. He got to his feet and began thrashing his arms about.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> stumped through the turnstile at the end of the L line. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename> <surname>Herf</surname></persName> followed him looking from <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> side to the other. Outside it was dark, a blizzard wind whistled about their ears. A single Ford sedan was waiting outside the station.</p>

    <p><said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"How you like, <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb"><orig>Meester</orig></roleName> <surname><orig>'Erf</orig></surname></persName>?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Fine <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName>. Is that water?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"That <placeName>Sheepshead <geogFeat>Bay</geogFeat></placeName>."</said></p>

    <p>They walked along the road, dodging an occasional blue-steel glint of a puddle. The arclights had a look of shrunken grapes swaying in the wind. To the right and left were flickering patches of houses in the distance. They stopped at a long building propped on piles over the water. Pool; <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> barely made out the letters on an unlighted window. The door opened as they reached it. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><forename>Mike</forename></persName>,"</said> said <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName>. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"This is <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb"><orig>Meester</orig></roleName> <surname><orig>'Erf</orig></surname></persName>, a <orig>frien'</orig> <orig>o</orig> mine."</said> The door closed behind them. Inside it was black as an oven. A calloused hand grabbed <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename><surname>Herf</surname></persName>'s hand in the dark.</p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Glad to meet you,"</said> said a voice.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Say how did you find my hand?"</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh I kin see in the dark."</said> The voice laughed throatily.</p>

    <p>By that time <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> had opened the inner door. Light streamed through picking out billiard tables, a long bar at the end, racks of cues. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"This is <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><forename>Mike</forename> <surname>Cardinale</surname></persName>,"</said> said <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName>. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> found himself standing beside a tall sallow shylooking man with bunchy black hair growing low on his forehead. In the inner room were shelves full of chinaware and a round table covered by a piece of mustardcolored oilcloth. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"Eh <foreign xml:lang="fr">la patronne</foreign>,"</said> shouted <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName>. A fat <nationality>French</nationality> woman with red applecheeks came out through the further door; behind her came a chiff of sizzling butter and garlic. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"This is <orig>frien</orig> <orig>o</orig> mine. . . . Now maybe we eat,"</said> shouted <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName>. <said who="#MikeCardinale" aloud="true" direct="true">"She my wife,"</said> said <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><surname>Cardinale</surname></persName> proudly. <said who="#MikeCardinale" aloud="true" direct="true">"Very deaf. . . .

    <p><said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Havent</orig> you got a little peekmeup?"</said> said <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName>. He let himself down with a grunt into a chair.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><surname>Cardinale</surname></persName> set a fat fiasco of wine on the table and some glasses. They tasted it smacking their lips. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"Bettern Dago Red, eh <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb"><orig>Meester</orig></roleName> <surname><orig>'Erf</orig></surname></persName>?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"It sure is. Tastes like real <orgName>Chianti</orgName>."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#AnnetteCardinale"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Cardinale</surname></persName> set <num type="cardinal" value="6">six</num> plates with a stained fork, knife, and spoon in each and then put a steaming tureen of soup in the middle of the table.</p>

    <p><said who="#AnnetteCardinale" aloud="true" direct="true">"Pronto pasta,"</said> she shrieked in a guineahen voice.</p>

    <p><said who="#MikeCardinale" aloud="true" direct="true">"Thisa <persName ref="#AnnetteCardinale"><addName type="nickname">Anetta</addName></persName>,"</said> said <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><surname>Cardinale</surname></persName> as a pinkcheeked blackhaired girl with long lashes curving back from bright black eyes ran into the room followed by a heavily tanned young man in khaki overalls with curly sunbleached hair. They all sat down at once and began to eat the peppery thick vegetable chowder, leaning far over their plates.</p>

    <p>When <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> had finished his soup he looked up. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><forename>Mike</forename></persName> did you see lights?"</said> <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><surname>Cardinale</surname></persName> nodded. <said who="#MikeCardinale" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sure <orig>ting</orig> . . . be here any time."</said> While they were eating a dish of fried eggs and garlic, frizzled veal cutlets with fried potatoes and broccoli, <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName> began to hear in the distance the pop pop pop of a motorboat. <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> got up from the table with a motion to them to be quiet and looked out the window, cautiously lifting a corner of the shade, <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"That him,"</said> he said as he stumped back to the table. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"We eat good here, eh <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb"><orig>Meester</orig></roleName> Erf</persName>?"</said></p>

    <p>The young-man got to his feet wiping his mouth on his forearm. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Got <measure type="currency">a nickel</measure> <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName>,"</said> he said doing a double shuffle with his sneakered feet. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Here go Johnny."</said> The girl followed him out into the dark outer room. In a moment a mechanical piano started tinkling out a waltz. Through the door <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> could see them dancing in and out of the oblong of light. The chugging of the motorboat drew nearer. <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> went out, then <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><surname>Cardinale</surname></persName> and his wife, until <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> was left alone sipping a glass of wine among the debris of the dinner. He felt excited and puzzled and a little drunk. Already he began to construct the story in his mind. From the road came the grind of gears of a truck, then of another. The motorboat engine choked, backfired and stopped. There was the creak of a boat against the piles, a swash of waves and silence. The mechanical piano had stopped. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> sat sipping his wine. He could smell the rankness of salt marshes seeping into the house. Under him there was a little lapping sound of the water against the piles. Another motorboat was beginning to sputter in the far distance.</p>

    <p><said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"Got <measure type="currency">a nickel</measure>?"</said> asked <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> breaking into the room suddenly. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"Make music. . . . Very funny night tonight. Maybe you and <persName ref="#AnnetteCardinale"><forename>Annette</forename></persName> keep piano goin. I <orig>didnt</orig> see <persName>Mc Gee</persName> about landin. . . . Maybe somebody come. Must be veree quick."</said> <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> got to his feet and started fishing in his pockets. By the piano he found <persName ref="#AnnetteCardinale"><forename>Annette</forename></persName>. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Wont</orig> you dance?"</said> She nodded. The piano played <title>Innocent Eyes</title>. They danced distractedly. Outside were voices and footsteps. <said who="#AnnetteCardinale" aloud="true" direct="true">"Please,"</said> she said all at once and they stopped dancing. The <num type="ordinal" value="2">second</num> motorboat had come very near; the motor coughed and rattled still. <said who="#AnnetteCardinale" aloud="true" direct="true">"Please stay here,"</said> she said and slipped away from him.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename><surname>Herf</surname></persName> walked up and down uneasily puffing on a cigarette. He was making up the story in his mind. . . . In a lonely abandoned dancehall on <placeName>Sheepshead <geogFeat>Bay</geogFeat></placeName> . . . lovely blooming <nationality>Italian</nationality> girl . . . shrill whistle in the dark. . . . I ought to get out and see what's going on. He groped for the front door. It was locked. He walked over to the piano and put another <measure type="currency">nickel</measure> in. Then he lit a fresh cigarette and started walking up and down again. Always the way . . . a parasite on the drama of life, reporter looks at everything through a peephole. Never mixes in. The piano was playing <title>Yes We Have No Bananas</title>. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh hell!"</said> he kept muttering and ground his teeth and walked up and down.</p>

    <p>Outside the tramp of steps broke into a scuffle, voices snarled. There was a splintering of wood and the crash of breaking bottles. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> looked out through the window of the diningroom. He could see the shadows of men struggling and slugging on the boatlanding. He rushed into the kitchen, where he bumped into <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> sweaty and staggering into the house leaning on a heavy cane.</p>

    <p><said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"<distinct type="swearing">Goddam</distinct>. . . <orig>dey</orig> break my leg,"</said> he shouted.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Good God."</said> <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> helped him groaning into the diningroom.</p>

    <p><said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"Cost me <measure type="currency"><num type="cardinal" value="50"><orig>feefty</orig></num> dollars</measure> to have it mended last time I busted it."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sure what you <orig>tink</orig>?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Is it prohibition agents?"</said></p>

    <p>When <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> got back to him, <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> was sitting in a chair nursing his stump with his <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> hands. On the table lay the cork and aluminum limb splintered and dented. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"<foreign xml:lang="fr">Regardez moi √ßa . . . c'est foutu . . . completement foutu</foreign>."</said> As he spoke <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><surname>Cardinale</surname></persName> came in. He had a deep gash over his eyes from which a trickle of blood ran down his cheek on his coat and shirt. His wife followed him rolling back her eyes; she had a basin and a sponge with which she kept making ineffectual dabs at his forehead. He pushed her away. <said who="#MikeCardinale" aloud="true" direct="true">"I crowned <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> of em good wid a piece o pipe. I think he fell in de water.

    <p><said who="#MikeCardinale" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh shut up,"</said> growled <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><surname>Cardinale</surname></persName>. He had dropped into a chair and his wife was sponging off his face. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"Did you get a good look at the boat?"</said> asked <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName>.</p>

    <p>Joggling home in the empty train through empty <placeName><district>Brooklyn</district></placeName> suburbs <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> tried to think of the bootlegging story he'd write for the <title>Sunday Magazine Section</title>. The girl's pink cheeks and toobright eyes kept intervening, blurring the orderly arrangement of his thoughts. He sank gradually into dreamier and dreamier reverie. Before the kid was born <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> sometimes had toobright eyes like that. The time on the hill when she had suddenly wilted in his arms and been sick and he had left her among the munching, calmly staring cows on the grassy slope and gone to a shepherd's hut and brought back milk in a wooden ladle, and slowly as the mountains hunched up with evening the color had come back into her cheeks and she had looked at him that way and said with a dry little laugh: It's the little Herf inside me. God why <orig>cant</orig> I stop mooning over things that are past And when the baby was coming and <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> was in the <title><nationality>American</nationality> Hospital</title> at <placeName>Neuilly</placeName>, himself wandering distractedly through the fair, going into the <placeName>Flea Circus</placeName>, riding on merrygorounds and the steam swing, buying toys, candy, taking chances on dolls in a crazy blur, stumbling back to the hospital with a big plaster pig under his arm. Funny these fits of refuge in the past. Suppose she had died; I thought she would. The past would have been complete all round, framed, worn round your neck like a cameo, set up in type, molded on plates for the <title>Magazine Section</title>, like the <num type="ordinal" value="1">first</num> of <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="birth"><persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="birth">James</addName></persName></addName><surname>Herf</surname></persName>'s articles on <title>The Bootlegging Ring</title>.

As soon as he pressed the bell the catch on the door began to click.

    <p><persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename> <surname>Herf</surname></persName> yawned and scraped back his chair. The <measure type="currency">nickel</measure> glints of the typewriter hurt his eyes. The tips of his fingers were sore. He pushed open the sliding doors a little and peeped into the cold bedroom. He could barely make out <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> asleep in the bed in the alcove. At the far end of the room was the baby's crib. There was a faint milkish sour smell of babyclothes. He pushed the doors to again and began to undress. If we only had more space, he was muttering; we live cramped in our squirrelcage. . . . He pulled the dusty cashmere off the couch and yanked his pyjamas out from under the pillow. Space space cleanness quiet; the words were gesticulating in his mind as if he were addressing a vast auditorium.</p>

    <p>He turned out the light, opened a crack of the window and dropped wooden with sleep into bed. Immediately he was writing a letter on a linotype. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="false" direct="true">Now I lay me down to sleep . . . mother of the great white twilight.</said> The arm of the linotype was a woman's hand in a long white glove. Through the clanking from behind amber foots <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName>'s voice <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true"><orig>Dont</orig>, <orig>dont</orig>, <orig>dont</orig>, you're hurting me so. . . . <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Herf</surname></persName>, says a man in overalls, you're hurting the machine and we <orig>wont</orig> be able to get out the bullgod edition thank dog.</said> The linotype was a gulping mouth with nickelbright rows of teeth, gulped, crunched. He woke up sitting up in bed. He was cold, his teeth were chattering. He pulled the covers about him and settled to sleep again. The next time he woke up it was daylight. He was warm and happy. Snowflakes were dancing, hesitating, spinning, outside the tall window.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName>,"</said> said <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> coming towards him with a tray.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"No it's Sunday morning. . . . I thought you needed a little luxury. . . . I made some corn muffins."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"You mean move?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"No. I was thinking if you could get another room to sleep in somewhere round, then nobody'd ever disturb you in the morning."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#MartinHerf"><forename>Martin</forename></persName>'s crying came in a gust from the other room. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> sat on the edge of the bed with the empty coffeecup on his knees looking at his bare feet. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Just as you like,"</said> he said dully. An impulse to grab her hands to crush her to him until he hurt her went up through him like a rocket and died. She picked up the coffeethings and swished away. His lips knew her lips, his arms knew the twining of her arms, he knew the deep woods of her hair, he loved her. He sat for a long time looking at his feet, lanky reddish feet with swollen blue veins, shoebound toes twisted by stairs and pavements. On each little toe there was a corn. He found his eyes filling with pitying tears. The baby had stopped crying. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> went into the bathroom and started the water running in the tub.</p>

    <p><said who="#Elmer" aloud="true" direct="true">"It was that other feller you had <persName ref="#AnnaCohen"><forename>Anna</forename></persName>. He got you to <orig>thinkin</orig> you <orig>didnt</orig> give a damn. . . . He made you a fatalist."</said></p>

    <p>They are walking slowly up <address><num type="ordinal" value="2">Second</num> Avenue</address> through a foggy evening. He is a rustyhaired thinfaced young <nationality>Jew</nationality> with sunken cheeks and livid pale skin. He has the bandy legs of a garment worker. <persName ref="#AnnaCohen"><forename>Anna</forename></persName>'s shoes are too small for her. She has deep rings under her eyes. The fog is full of strolling groups talking Yiddish, overaccented East Side <nationality>English</nationality>, <nationality>Russian</nationality>. Warm rifts of light from delicatessen stores and softdrink stands mark off the glistening pavement.</p>

    <p><said who="#AnnaCohen" aloud="true" direct="true">"If I didn't feel so tired all the time,"</said> mutters <persName ref="#AnnaCohen"><forename>Anna</forename></persName>.</p>

    <p><said who="#Elmer" aloud="true" direct="true">"That'll juss make <orig>ye</orig> feel sick, but go ahead if you wanter."</said> She sat on the slender nickelbound stool. He stood beside her.

He was talking in a low impersonal voice. <said who="#Elmer" aloud="true" direct="true">"The trouble with the workers is we <orig>dont</orig> know nothin, we <orig>dont</orig> know how to eat, we <orig>dont</orig> know how to live, we <orig>dont</orig> know how to protect our rights. . . .

    <p><persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> looked at himself in the mirror as he washed his hands in the Httle washroom behind his office. His hair that still grew densely down to a point on his forehead was almost white. There was a deep line at each corner of his mouth and across his chin. Under his bright gimleteyes the skin was sagging and granulated. When he had wiped his hands slowly and meticulously he took a little box of strychnine pills from the upper pocket of his vest, swallowed one, and feeling the anticipated stimulus tingle through him went back into his office. A longnecked <occupation>officeboy</occupation> was fidgeting beside his desk with a card in his hand.</p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"A lady wants to speak to you sir."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"Has she an appointment? Ask <persName><roleName type="honorific">Miss</roleName> <surname>Ranke</surname></persname>. . . . Wait <time dur-iso="PT1M">a minute</time>. Show the lady right through into this office."</said></p>

    <p>The card read <persName ref="#NellieMcNiel"><forename>Nellie</forename> <forename sort="2">Linihan</forename> <surname>McNiel</surname></persName>. She was expensively dressed with a lot of lace in the opening of her big fur coat. Round her neck she had a lorgnette on an amethyst chain.</p>

    <p><said who="#NellieMcNiel" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#GusMcNiel"><forenamme>Gus</forenamme></persName> asked me to come to see you,"</said> she said as he motioned her into a chair beside the desk.</p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"What can I do for you?"</said> His heart for some reason was pounding hard.</p>

    <p>She looked at him a moment through her lorgnette. <said who="#NellieMcNiel" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName> you stand it better than <persName ref="#GusMcNiel"><forename>Gus</forename></persName> does."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"What?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NellieMcNiel" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh all this. . . . I'm trying to get <persName ref="#GusMcNiel"><forename>Gus</forename></persName> to go away with me for a rest abroad . . . Marianbad or something like that . . . but he says he's in too deep to pull up his stakes."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"I guess that's true of all of us,"</said> said <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> with a cold smile.</p>

    <p>They were silent <time dur-iso="PT1M">a minute</time>, then <persName ref="#NellieMcNiel"><forename>Nellie</forename> <surname>McNiel</surname></persName> got to her feet. <said who="#NellieMcNiel" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look here <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forname>George</forname></persName>, <persName ref="#GusMcNiel"><forename>Gus</forename></persName> is awfully cut up about this. . . . You know he likes to stand by his friends and have his friends stand by him."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"Nobody can say that I <orig>havent</orig> stood by him. . . . It's simply this, I'm not a <occupation>politician</occupation>, and as, probably foolishly, I've allowed myself to be nominated for office, I have to run on a nonpartisan basis."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NellieMcNiel" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName> that's only half the story and you know it."</said></p>



    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"Tell him that I've always been and always shall be a good friend of his. . . . He knows that perfectly well. In this particular campaign I have pledged myself to oppose certain elements with which <persName ref="#GusMcNiel"><forename>Gus</forename></persName> has let himself get involved."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NellieMcNiel" aloud="true" direct="true">"You're a fine talker <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> and you always were."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> flushed. They stood stiff side by side at the office door. His hand lay still on the doorknob as if paralyzed. From the outer offices came the sound of typewriters and voices. From outside came the long continuous tapping of riveters at work on a new building.</p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"I hope your family's all well,"</said> he said at length with an effort.</p>

    <p><said who="#NellieMcNiel" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh yes they are all well thanks . . . <distinct type="old-fashioned">Goodby</distinct>."</said> She had gone.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> stood for a moment looking out of the window at the gray blackwindowed building opposite. Silly to let things agitate him so. Need of relaxation. He got his hat and coat from their hook behind the washroom door and went out.</p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName><surname>Jonas</surname></persName>,"</said> he said to a man with a round bald head shaped like a cantaloupe who sat poring over papers in the highceilinged library that was the central hall of the lawoffice, <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"bring everything up that's on my desk. . . . I'll go over it uptown tonight."</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"All right sir."</said></p>

    <p>When he got out on <address>Broadway</address> he felt like a small boy playing hooky. It was a sparkling winter afternoon with hurrying rifts of sun and cloud. He jumped into a taxi. Going uptown he lay back in the seat dozing. At <address><num type="ordinal" value="42">Forty-second</num> Street</address> he woke up. Everything was a confusion of bright intersecting planes of color, faces, legs, shop windows, trolleycars, automobiles. He sat up with his gloved hands on his knees, fizzling with excitement. Outside of <persName ref="#NevadaJones"><forename>Nevada</forename></persName>'s apartmenthouse he paid the taxi. The <occupation>driver</occupation> was a negro and showed an ivory mouthful of teeth when he got a <measure type="currency"><num type="cardinal" value="50">fifty</num>-cent</measure> tip. Neither elevator was there so <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> ran lightly up the stairs, half wondering at himself. He knocked on <persName ref="#NevadaJones"><forename>Nevada</forename></persName>'s door. No answer. He knocked again. She opened it cautiously. He could see her curly towhead. He brushed into the room before she could stop him. All she had on was a kimono over a pink chemise.</p>

    <p><said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"My God,"</said> she said, <said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"I thought you were the <occupation>waiter</occupation>."</said></p>

    <p>He grabbed her and kissed her. <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"I <orig>dont</orig> know why but I feel like a <age value="3">threeyear</age> old."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"You look like you was crazy with the heat. . . . I <orig>dont</orig> like you to come over without telephoning, you know that."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"You <orig>dont</orig> mind just this once I forgot."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> caught sight of something on the settee; he found himself staring at a pair of darkblue trousers neatly folded.</p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"I was feeling awfully fagged down at the office <persName ref="#NevadaJones"><forename>Nevada</forename></persName>. I thought I'd come up to talk to you to cheer myself up a bit."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"I was just practicing some dancing with the phonograph."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"Yes very interesting. . . ."</said> He began to walk springily up and down. <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"Now look here <persName ref="#NevadaJones"><forename>Nevada</forename></persName>. . . . We've got to have a talk. I <orig>dont</orig> care who it is you've got in your bedroom."</said> She looked suddenly in his face and sat down on the settee beside the trousers. <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"In fact I've known for some time that you and <persName ref="#TonyHunter"><forename>Tony</forename> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName> were carrying on."</said> She compressed her lips and crossed her legs. <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"In fact all this stuff and nonsense about his having to go to a <occupation>psychoanalyst</occupation> at <measure type="currency"><num type="cardinal" value="25">twentyfive</num> dollars</measure> <time dur-iso="PT1H">an hour</time> amused me enormously. . . . But just <time dur-iso="PT1M">this minute</time> I've decided I had enough. Quite enough."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName> you're crazy,"</said> she stammered and then suddenly she began to giggle.</p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"I tell you what I'll do,"</said> went on <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>in a clear legal voice, <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'll send you a check for <num type="cardinal" value="5">five</num> hundred, because you're a nice girl and I like you. The apartment's paid till the <num type="ordinal" value="1">first</num> of the month. Does that suit you? And please never communicate with me in any way."</said></p>

    <p>She was rolling on the settee giggling helplessly beside the neatly folded pair of darkblue trousers. <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> waved his hat and gloves at her and left closing the door very gently behind him. <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">Good riddance</said>, he said to himself as he closed the door carefully behind him.</p>

    <p>Down in the street again he began to walk briskly uptown. He felt excited and talkative. He wondered who he could go to see. Telling over the names of his friends made him depressed. He began to feel lonely, deserted. He wanted to be talking to a woman, making her sorry for the barrenness of his life. He went into a cigarstore and began looking through the phonebook. There was a faint flutter in him when he found the H's. At last he found the name <persName><surname>Herf</surname></persName>, <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Helena</addName> <surname>Oglethorpe</surname></persName>.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#NevadaJones"><forename>Nevada</forename> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> sat a long while on the settee giggling hysterically. At length <persName ref="#TonyHunter"><forename>Tony</forename> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName> came in in his shirt and drawers with his bow necktie perfectly tied.</p>

    <p><said who="#TonyHunter" aloud="true" direct="true">"Has he gone?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gone? sure he's gone, gone for good,"</said> she shrieked. <said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"He saw your damn pants."</said></p>

    <p>He let himself drop on a chair. <said who="#TonyHunter" aloud="true" direct="true">"O God if I'm not the unluckiest fellow in the world."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why?"</said> she sat spluttering with laughter with the tears running down her face.</p>

    <p><said who="#TonyHunter" aloud="true" direct="true">"Nothing goes right. That means it's all off about the matinees."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's back to <num type="cardinal" value="3">three</num> a day for little <persName ref="#NevadaJones"><forename>Nevada</forename></persName>. . . . I <orig>dont</orig> give a damn. . . . I never did like bein a kept woman."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#TonyHunter" aloud="true" direct="true">"But you're not thinking of my career. . . . Women are so selfish. If you hadn't led me on. . . ."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"Shut up you little fool. <orig>Dont</orig> you think I <orig>dont</orig> know all about you?"</said> She got to her feet with the kimono pulled tight about her.</p>

    <p><said who="#TonyHunter" aloud="true" direct="true">"God all I needed was a chance to show what I could do, and now I'll never get it,"</said> <persName ref="#TonyHunter"><forename>Tony</forename></persName> was groaning.</p>

    <p><said who="" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sure you will if you do what I tell you. I set out to make a man of you kiddo and I'm goin to do it. . . . We'll get up an act.

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Is that all right for length sir,"</said> asked the <occupation>fitter</occupation> busily making marks on the trousers with a piece of chalk.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#JamesMeravile"><forename>James</forename> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName> looked down at the <occupation>fitter</occupation>'s little greenish wizened bald head and at the brown trousers flowing amply about his feet. <said who="#JamesMeravile" aloud="true" direct="true">"A little shorter. . . .

    <p><said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why hello <persName ref="#JamesMeravile"><forename>James</forename> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName> I didn't know you bought your clothes at Brooks' too. <distinct type="slang">Gee</distinct> I'm glad to see you."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#JamesMeravile"><forename>James</forename> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName>'s blood stood still. He found himself looking straight in the blue alcoholic eyes of <persName ref="#JackCunningham"><forename>Jack</forename> <surename>Cunningham</surename></persName>. He bit his lip and tried to stare at him coldly without speaking.</p>

    <p><said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"God Almighty, do you know what we've done?"</said> cried out <persName ref="#JackCunningham"><surname>Cunningham</surname></persName>. <said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"We've bought the same suit of clothes. . . . I tell you it's identically the same."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#JamesMerivale"><forename>James</forename> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName> was looking in bewilderment from <persName ref="#JackCunningham"><surname>Cunningham</surname></persName>'s brown trousers to his own, the same color, the same tiny stripe of red and faint mottling of green.</p>

    <p><said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"Good God man <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> future brothersinlaw <orig>cant</orig> wear the same suit. People'll think it's a uniform. . . . It's ridiculous."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"We have to toss up and see who gets it that's all. . . . Will you lend me a quarter please?"</said> <persName ref="#JackCunningham"><surname>Cunningham</surname></persName> turned to his <occupation>salesman</occupation>. <said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right. . . .

    <p><said who="#JamesMeravile" aloud="true" direct="true">"Heads,"</said> said <persName ref="#JamesMeravile"><forename>James</forename> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName> mechanically.</p>

    <p><said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"The brown suit is yours. . . . Now I've got to choose another . . . God I'm glad we met when we did.

    <p><persName ref="#JamesMerivale"><forename>James</forename> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName>'s hands were trembling as he fastened his belt.

    <p>They sat at a small table in the back of a dimly lighted tearoom. The shade on the lamp cut off the upper parts of their faces. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> had on a dress of bright peacock blue and a small blue hat with a piece of green in it. <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename><surname>Prynne</surname></persName>'s face had a sagging tired look under the street makeup.</p>

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Elaine</addName></persName>, you've just got to come,"</said> she was saying in a whiny voice, <said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#CassandraWilkins"><addName type="nickname">Cassie</addName></persName>'ll be there and <persName ref="#JohnOglethorpe"><surname>Oglethorpe</surname></persName> and all the old gang. . . .

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"No but <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename> </persName> it's just that I'm getting to hate large parties. I guess I must be getting old. All right I'll come for a little while."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename> </persName> put down the sandwich she was nibbling at and reached for <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName>'s hand and patted it. <said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"That's the little trouper. . . .

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"Dear you <orig>dont</orig> understand . . . You never will understand."</said></p>

    <p>They sat a long while without saying anything, scraps of lowvoiced conversation came to them from other corners of the dim tearoom. The palehaired waitress brought them <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> orders of fruit salad.</p>

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"My it must be getting late,"</said> said <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename></persName> eventually.</p>

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh but it must be wonderful though."</said></p>

    <p>They rang a bell under a small brass placque that read: <floatingText><persName ref="#HesterVoorhees"><forename>Hester</forename> <surname>Voorhees</surname></persName> Interpretation of the Dance</floatingText>. They went up <num type="cardinal" value="3">three</num> flights of creaky freshvarnished stairs.

    <p>When <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> came out of the bedroom where she had left her wraps a tall figure in <nationality>Egyptian</nationality> headdress with crooked rusty eyebrows accosted her. <said who="#JohnOglethorpe" aloud="true" direct="true">"Allow me to salute <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Helena</addName> <surname type="married">Herf</surname></persName>, distinguished editress of Manners, the journal that brings the <placeName>Ritz</placeName> to the humblest fireside . . . <orig>isnt</orig> that true?"</said></p>

    <p>They sat down on a couch in a recess between the dormer windows. Out of the corner of her eye she could see a girl dancing in green silk veils. The phonograph was playing the <title>Cesar Frank</title> symphony.</p>

    <p><said who="#JohnOglethorpe" aloud="true" direct="true">"We <orig>mustnt</orig> miss <persName ref="#CassandraWilkins"><addName type="nickname">Cassie</addName></persName>'s daunce. The poor girl would be dreadfully offended."</said></p>

    <p>He shook his head and made a broad gesture with his draped arm. <said who="#JohnOglethorpe" aloud="true" direct="true">"Ah let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the deaths of kings."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> looked from <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> to the other; <persName ref="#JohnOglethorpe"><surname>Oglethorpe </surname></persName> crooked his eyebrows and nodded.</p>

    <p>Then <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> sat alone for a long while looking at the dancing and the chittering crowded room through a dim haze of boredom.</p>

    <p>The record on the phonograph was <nationality>Turkish</nationality>. <persName ref="#HesterVoorhees"><forename>Hester</forename> <surname>Voorhees</surname></persName>, a skinny woman with a mop of hennaed hair cut short at the level of her ears, came out holding a pot of drawling incense out in front of her preceded by <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> young men who unrolled a carpet as she came. She wore silk bloomers and a clinking metal girdle and brassieres. Everybody was clapping and saying, <said aloud="true" direct="true">"How wonderful, how marvelous,"</said> when from another room came <num type="cardinal" value="3">three</num> tearing shrieks of a woman. Everybody jumped to his feet. A stout man in a derby hat appeared in the doorway. <said aloud="true" direct="true">"All right little goils, right through into the back room. Men stay here."</said></p>


    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Who are you anyway?"</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Never mind who I am, you do as I say."</said> The man's face was red as a beet under the derby hat.</p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"It's a <occupation>detective</occupation>." <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's outrageous. Let him show his badge."</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"It's a holdup."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's a raid."</said></p>

    <p>The room had filled suddenly with <occupation>detectives</occupation>. They stood in front of the windows. A man in a checked cap with a face knobbed like a squash stood in front of the fireplace. They were pushing the women roughly into the back room. The men were herded in a little group near the door; <occupation>detectives</occupation> were taking their names. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> still sat on the couch. <said aloud="true" direct="true">". . . complaint phoned to headquarters,"</said> she heard somebody say. Then she noticed that there was a phone on the little table beside the couch where she sat. She picked it up and whispered softly for a number.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello is this the <occupation>district attorney</occupation>'s office? . . . I want to speak to <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> please. . . .   <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName>. . . .

    <p>The man in the derby was standing over her. <said aloud="true" direct="true">"All right phoning <orig>wont</orig> do no good. . . . Go 'long in the other room."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"I've got the <occupation>district attorney</occupation>'s office on the wire. You speak to him. . . .

    <p>She handed the telephone to the <occupation>detective</occupation> and walked out into the center of the room. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="false" direct="true">My I wish I <orig>hadnt</orig> taken my hat off</said>, she was thinking.</p>

    <p>From the other room came a sound of sobbing and <persName ref="#HesterVoorhees"><forename>Hester</forename> <surname>Voorhees</surname></persName>' stagy voice shrieking, <said who="#HesterVoorhees" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's a horrible mistake. . . . I <orig>wont</orig> be insulted like this."</said></p>

    <p>The <occupation>detective</occupation> put down the telephone. He came over to <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName>. <said aloud="true" direct="true">"I want to apologize miss. . . . We acted on insufficient information.

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"You'd better apologize to <persName ref="#HesterVoorhees"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Voorhees</surname></persName>. . . . It's her studio."</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Well ladies and gents,"</said> the <occupation>detective</occupation> began in a loud cheerful voice, <said aloud="true" direct="true">"we've made a little mistake and we're very sorry. . . . Accidents will happen . . ."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> slipped into the side room to get her hat and coat. She stood some time before the mirror powdering her nose. When she went out into the studio again everybody was talking at once. Men and women stood round with sheets and bathrobes draped over their scanty dancingclothes. The <occupation>detectives</occupation> had melted away as suddenly as they came. <persName ref="#JohnOglethorpe"><surname>Oglethorpe</surname></persName> was talking in loud impassioned tones in the middle of a group of young men.</p>

    <p><said who="#JohnOglethorpe" aloud="true" direct="true">"The scoundrels to attack women,"</said> he was shouting, red in the face, waving his headdress in <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> hand. <said who="#JohnOglethorpe" aloud="true" direct="true">"Fortunately I was able to control myself or I might have committed an act that I should have regretted to my dying day. . . . It was only with the greatest selfcontrol. . ."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> managed to slip out, ran down the stairs and out into drizzly streets. She hailed a taxi and went home. When she had got her things off she called up <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> at his house. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName>, I'm terribly sorry I had to trouble you and <persName><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Winthrop</surname></persName>. Well if you <orig>hadnt</orig> happened to say at lunch you'd be there all the evening they probably would be just piling us out of the black maria at the <placeName>Jefferson Market Court</placeName>. . . . Of course it was funny. I'll tell you about it sometime, but I'm so sick of all that stuff. . . . Oh just everything like that aesthetic dancing and literature and radicalism and psychoanalysis. . . . Just an overdose I guess. . . . Yes I guess that's it <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName> . . . I guess I'm growing up."</said></p>

    <p>The night was <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> great chunk of black grinding cold. The smell of the presses still in his nose, the chirrup of typewriters still in his ears, <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename><surname>Herf</surname></persName> stood in <address>City Hall Square</address> with his hands in his pockets watching ragged men with caps and earsflaps pulled down over faces and necks the color of raw steak shovel snow. Old and young their faces were the same color, their clothes were the same color. A razor wind cut his ears and made his forehead ache between the eyes.</p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName>, think you'll take the job?"</said> said a milkfaced young man who came up to him breezily and pointed to the pile of snow. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why not, Dan. I <orig>dont</orig> know why it <orig>wouldnt</orig> be better than spending all your life rooting into other people's affairs until you're nothing but a <distinct type="taboo">goddam</distinct> traveling dictograph."</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"It'd be a fine job in summer all right. . . . Taking the West Side?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm going to walk up. . . . I've got the heebyjeebies tonight."</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Jez man you'll freeze to death."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I <orig>dont</orig> care if I do. . . . You get so you <orig>dont</orig> have any private life, you're just an automatic writing machine."</said></p>

    <p>Laughing, <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename> <surname>Herf</surname></persName> turned his back on the snowshovelers and started walking up <address>Broadway</address>, leaning into the wind with his chin buried in his coatcollar. At <address>Houston Street</address> he looked at his watch. <time when="17:00:00"><num type="cardinal" value="5">Five</num> o'clock</time>. Gosh he was late today. Wouldnt be a place in the world where he could get a drink. He whimpered to himself at the thought of the icy blocks he still had to walk before he could get to his room. Now and then he stopped to pat some life into his numb ears. At last he got back to his room, lit the gasstove and hung over it tingling. His room was a small square bleak room on the south side of <address>Washington Square</address>. Its only furnishings were a bed, a chair, a table piled with books, and the gasstove. When he had begun to be a little less cold he reached under the bed for a basketcovered bottle of rum. He put some water to heat in a tin cup on the gasstove and began drinking hot rum and water. Inside him all sorts of unnamed agonies were breaking loose. He felt like the man in the fairy story with an iron band round his heart. The iron band was breaking.</p>

    <p>He had finished the rum. Occasionally the room would start going round him solemnly and methodically. Suddenly he said aloud: <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I've got to talk to her . . . I've got to talk to her."</said> He shoved his hat down on his head and pulled on his coat. Outside the cold was balmy. <num type="cardinal" value="6">Six</num> milkwagons in a row passed jingling.</p>

    <p>On <address>West <num type="ordinal" value="12">Twelfth</num></address> <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> black cats were chasing each other. Everywhere was full of their crazy yowling. He felt that something would snap in his head, that he himself would scuttle off suddenly down the frozen street eerily caterwauling.</p>

    <p>He stood shivering in the dark passage, ringing the bell marked <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname> again and again. Then he knocked as loud as he could. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> came to the door in a green wrapper.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"What's the matter <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName>? <orig>Havent</orig> you got a key?"</said> Her face was soft with sleep; there was a happy cozy suave smell of sleep about her. He talked through clenched teeth breathlessly.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> I've got to talk to you."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Are you lit, <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName>?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I know what I'm saying."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm terribly sleepy."</said></p>

    <p>He followed her into her bedroom. She kicked off her slippers and got back into bed, sat up looking at him with sleepweighted eyes.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Dont</orig> talk too loud on account of <persName ref="#MartinHerf"><forename>Martin</forename></persName>."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> I <orig>dont</orig> know why it's always so difficult for me to speak out about anything. . . . I always have to get drunk to speak out. . . . Look here do you like me any more?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"You know I'm awfully fond of you and always shall be."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I mean love, you know what I mean, whatever it is . . ."</said> he broke in harshly.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"I guess I <orig>dont</orig> love anybody for long unless they're dead. . . . I'm a terrible sort of person. It's no use talking about it."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I knew it. You knew I knew it. O God things are pretty rotten for me <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName>."</said></p>

    <p>She sat with her knees hunched up and her hands clasped round them looking at him with wide eyes. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Are you really so crazy about me <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName>?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look here lets get a divorce and be done with it."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Dont</orig> be in such a hurry, <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName>. . . . And there's <persName ref="#MartinHerf"><forename>Martin</forename></persName>. What about him?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I can scrape up enough money for him occasionally, poor little kid."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"I make more than you do, <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName>. . . . You <orig>shouldnt</orig> do that yet."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I know. I know. <orig>Dont</orig> I know it?"</said></p>

    <p>They sat looking at each other without speaking. Their eyes burned from looking at each other. Suddenly <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> wanted terribly to be asleep, not to remember anything, to let his head sink into blackness, as into his mother's lap when he was a kid.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I'm going home."</said> He gave a little dry laugh. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"We didn't think it'd all go pop like this, did we?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Goodnight <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName>,"</said> she whined in the middle of a yawn.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"But things <orig>dont</orig> end. . . . If only I <orig>weren'</orig> so terribly sleepy. . . . Will you put out the light?"</said></p>

    <p>He groped his way in the dark to the door. Outside the arctic morning was growing gray with dawn. He hurried back to his room. He wanted to get into bed and be asleep before it was light.</p>

    <p>A long low room with long tables down the middle piled with silk and cr√™pe fabrics, brown, salmonpink, emeraldgreen. A smell of snipped thread and dress materials. All down the tables bowed heads auburn, blond, black, brown of girls sewing. Errandboys pushing rolling stands of hung dresses up and down the aisles. A bell rings and the room breaks out with noise and talk shrill as a birdhouse.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#AnnaCohen"><forename>Anna</forname></persName> gets up and stretches out her arms. <said who="#AnnaCohen" aloud="true" direct="true">"My I've got a head,"</said> she says to the girl next her.</p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Up last night?"</said></p>

    <p>She nods.</p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Ought to quit it dearie, it'll spoil your looks. A girl <orig>cant</orig> burn the candle at both ends like a feller can."</said> The other girl is thin and blond and has a crooked nose. She puts her arm round <persName ref="#AnnaCohen"><forename>Anna</forname></persName>'s waist. <said aloud="true" direct="true">"My I wish I could put on a little of your weight."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#AnnaCohen" aloud="true" direct="true">"I wish you could,"</said> says <persName ref="#AnnaCohen"><forename>Anna</forname></persName>. <said aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Dont</orig> matter what I eat it turns to fat."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#AnnaCohen" aloud="true" direct="true">"Still you <distinct type="informal"><orig>aint</orig></distinct> too fat. . . . You're juss plump so's they like to squeeze ye. You try wearing boyishform like I told an you'll look fine."</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"My boyfriend says he likes a girl to have shape."</said></p>

    <p>On the stairs they push their way through a group of girls listening to a little girl with red hair who talks fast, opening her mouth wide and rolling her eyes. <said aloud="true" direct="true">". . . She lived just on the next block at <address><num type="cardinal" value="2230">2230</num> Cameron Avenue</address> an she'd been to the <placeName>Hippodrome</placeName> with some girlfriends and when they got home it was late an they let her go home alone, up <address>Cameron Avenue</address>, see? <orig>An</orig> the next morning when her folks began looking for her they found her behind a <orgName>Spearmint</orgName> sign in a back lot."</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Was she dead?"</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Sure she was. . . . A negro had done somethin terrible to her and then he'd strangled her. . . . I felt terrible. I used to go to school with her. <orig>An</orig> there <distinct type="informal"><orig>aint</orig></distinct> a girl on <address>Cameron Avenue</address> been out after dark they're so scared."</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Sure I saw all about it in the paper last night. Imagine livin right on the next block."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#RosieSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"Did you see me touch that hump back?"</said> cried <persName ref="#RosieSilverman"><forename>Rosie</forename></persName> as he settled down beside her in the taxi. <said who="#JakeSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"In the lobby of the theater?"</said> He pulled at the trousers that were tight over his knees. <said who="#RosieSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"That's goin to give us luck <persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><forename>Jake</forename></persName>. I never seen a hump back to fail. . . . if you touch him on the hump . . . Ou it makes me sick how fast these taxis go."</said> They were thrown forward by the taxi's sudden stop. <said who="#RosieSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"My God we almost ran over a boy."</said> <persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><forename>Jake</forename> <surname>Silverman</surname></persName> patted her knee. <said who="#RosieSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"Poor ikle kid, was it all worked up?"</said> As they drove up to the hotel she shivered and buried her face in her coatcollar. When they went to the desk to get the key, the clerk said to <persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><surname>Silverman</surname></persName>, <said aloud="true" direct="true">"There's a gentleman waiting to see you sir."</said> A thickset man came up to him taking a cigar out of his mouth. <said who="#MrRogers" aloud="true" direct="true">"Will you step this way <time dur-iso="PT1M">a minute</time> please <persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Silverman</surname></persName>."</said> <persName ref="#RosieSilverman"><forename>Rosie</forename></persName> thought she was going to faint. She stood perfectly stilly frozen, with her cheeks deep in the fur collar of her coat.</p>

    <p>They sat in <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> deep armchairs and whispered with their heads together. Step by step, she got nearer, listening. <said who="#JakeSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"Warrant . . . Department of Justice . . . using the mails to defraud . . ."</said> She <orig>couldnt</orig> hear what <persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><forename>Jake</forename></persName> said in between. He kept nodding his head as if agreeing. Then suddenly he spoke out smoothly, smiling.</p>

    <p><said who="#JakeSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I've heard your side <persName ref="#MrRogers"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rogers</surname></persName>. . . . Here's mine. If you arrest me now I shall be ruined and a great many people who have put their money in this enterprise will be ruined. . . . In a week I can liquidate the whole concern with a profit. . . . <persName ref="#MrRogers"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rogers</surname></persName> I am a man who has been deeply wronged through foolishness in misplacing confidence in others."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#MrRogers" aloud="true" direct="true">"I <orig>cant</orig> help that. . . . My duty is to execute the warrant. . . . I'm afraid I'll have to search your room. . . . You see we have several little items . . ."</said> The man flicked the ash off his cigar and began to read in a monotonous voice. <said who="#MrRogers" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><forename type="birth">Jacob</forename> <surname>Silverman</surname></persName>, alias <persName><forename>Edward</forename> <surname>Faversham</surname></persName>, <persName><forename>Simeon</forename> <forename full="abb">J.</forename> <surname>Arbuthnot</surname></persName>, <persName><forename>Jack</forename> <surname>Hinkley</surname></persName>,<persName><forename full="abb">J.</forename> <forename full="abb">J.</forename> <surname>Gold<surname></persName>. . . . Oh we've got a pretty little list. . . . We've done some very pretty work on your case, if I do say it what <orig>shouldnt</orig>."</said></p>



    <p>They got to their feet. The man with the cigar jerked his head at a lean man in a cap who sat reading a paper on the opposite side of the lobby.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><surname>Silverman</surname></persName> walked over to the desk. <said who="#JakeSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm called away on business,"</said> he said to the clerk. <said who="#JakeSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"Will you please have my bill prepared? <persName><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Silverman</surname></persName> will keep the room for a few days."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#RosieSilverman"><forename>Rosie</forename></persName> <orig>couldnt</orig> speak. She followed the <num type="cardinal" value="3">three</num> men into the elevator. <said ref="#MrRogers" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sorry to have to do this maam,"</said> said the lean <occupation>detective</occupation> pulling at the visor of his cap. <persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><surname>Silverman</surname></persName> opened the room door for them and closed it carefully behind him.</p>

    <p><said who="#JakeSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"Thank you for your consideration, gentlemen. . . . My wife thanks you."</said> <persName ref="#RosieSilverman"><forename>Rosie</forename></persName> sat in a straight chair in the corner of the room. She was biting her tongue hard, harder to try to keep her lips from twitching.</p>

    <p><said who="#MrRogers" aloud="true" direct="true">"We realize <persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Silverman</surname></persName> that this is not quite the ordinary criminal case."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JakeSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Wont</orig> you have a drink gentlemen?"</said></p>

    <p>They shook their heads. The thickset man was lighting a fresh cigar.</p>

    <p><said who="#MrRogers" aloud="true" direct="true">"Allright Mike,"</said> he said to the lean man. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Go through the drawers and closet."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JakeSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"Is that regular?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#MrRogers" aloud="true" direct="true">"If this was regular we'd have the handcuffs on you and be running the lady here as an accessory."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#RosieSilverman"><forename>Rosie</forename></persName> sat with her icy hands clasped between her knees swaying her body from side to side. Her eyes were closed. While the <occupation>detectives</occupation> were rummaging in the closet, <persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><surname>Silverman</surname></persName> took the opportunity to put his hand on her shoulder. She opened her eyes. <said who="#JakeSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"The minute the <distinct type="taboo">goddam</distinct> <distinct type="swearing">dicks</distinct> take me out phone <persName><surname>Schatz</surname></persName> and tell him everything. Get hold of him if you have to wake up everybody in <placeName><settlement type="city">New York</settlement></placeName>."</said> He spoke low and fast, his lips barely moving.</p>
    
    <p>Almost immediately he was gone, followed by the <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> <occupation>detectives</occupation> with a satchel full of letters. His kiss was still wet on her lips. She looked dazedly round the empty deathly quiet room. She noticed some writing on the lavender blotter on the desk. It was his handwriting, very scrawly: Hock everything and beat it; you are a good kid. Tears began running down her cheeks. She sat a long while with her head dropped on the desk kissing the penciled words on the blotter.</p>
