                    <p>Morning clatters with the <num type="ordinal" value="1">first</num> L train down <address>Allen Street</address>. Daylight rattles through the windows, shaking the old brick houses, splatters the girders of the L structure with bright confetti.</p>
                    
                    <p>The cats are leaving the garbage cans, the chinches are going back into the walls, leaving sweaty limbs, leaving the grimetender necks of little children asleep. Men and women stir under blankets and bedquilts on mattresses in the corners of rooms, clots of kids begin to untangle to scream and kick.</p>
                    
                    <p>At the corner of <address>Riverton</address> the old man with the hempen beard who sleeps where nobody knows is putting out his picklestand. Tubs of gherkins, pimentos, melonrind, piccalilli give out twining vines and cold tendrils of dank pepperyfragrance that grow like a marshgarden out of the musky bedsmells and the rancid clangor of the cobbled awakening street.</p>
                    
                    <p>The old man with the hempen beard who sleeps where nobody knows sits in the midst of it like <persName>Jonah</persName> under his gourd.</p>

He waited a long while beside a milkbottle, <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> creambottles, and a copy of the <title>Sunday Times</title>. There was a rustle behind the door and the creak of a step, then no more sound. He pushed a white button in the doorjamb.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Who is it?"</said> came a lisping female voice through a crack in the door.</p>

                    <p>Glimpse of a blue kimono held up to the chin of a fluffy face. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh I don't know if she's up yet."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Shall I bring in the milk?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh do and sit down in the hall and I'll call <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename></persName>."</said> The hall was very dark; smelled of sleep and toothpaste and massagecream; across <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> corner a cot still bore the imprint of a body on its rumpled sheets. Straw hats, silk eveningwraps, and a couple of men's dress overcoats hung in a jostling tangle from the staghorns of the hatrack. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forname>Jimmy</forename> </persName> picked a corsetcover off a rockingchair and sat down. Women's voices, a subdued rustling of people dressing, Sunday newspaper noises seeped out through the partitions of the different rooms.</p>

                    <p>The bathroom door opened; a stream of sunlight reflected out of a pierglass cut the murky hall in half, out of it came a head of hair like copper wire, bluedark eyes in a brittlewhite eggshaped face. Then the hair was brown down the hall above a slim back in a tangerine-colored slip, nonchalant pink heels standing up out of the bathslippers at every step.</p>

Then I'll be ready."</said> The little gray room was stuffed with clothes and photographs of stage people. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> stood with his back to the door, some sort of silky stuff that dangled from the hook tickling his ears.</p>

                    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well how's the cub reporter?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm on <placeName><district>Hell's Kitchen</district></placeName>. . . . It's swell. Got a job yet <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename></persName>?"</said></p>

Oh <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> I'm getting desperate."</said> She shook her hair loose of the crimpers and combed out the new mousybrown waves. She had a pale startled face with a big mouth and blue underlids. <said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"This morning I knew I ought to be up and ready, but I just couldn't. It's so discouraging to get up when you haven't got a job. . . . Sometimes I think I'll go to bed and just stay there till the end of the world."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Poor old <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename></persName>."</said></p>

                    <p>She threw a powderpuff at him that covered his necktie and the lapels of his blue serge suit with powder. <said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Dont</orig> you poor old me you little rat."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"That's a nice thing to do after all the trouble I took to make myself look respectable. . . . <distinct type="informal">Darn</distinct> your hide <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename></persName>.

                    <p><persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename></persName> threw back her head with a shrieking laugh. <said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh you're so comical <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName>.

                    <p>Blushing he blew down his chin at his tie. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Who's the funnylooking girl opened the halldoor?"</said></p>

                    <p>A girl with short black hair in a yellow jumper was folding the sheets off the cot in the hall. For <time dur-iso="PT1S">a second</time> under the ambercolored powder and the rouge <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> did not recognize the face he had seen through the crack in the door.</p>

                    <p>The door across the hall opened and <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> found himself looking in the white face of a crookednosed man whose red hair rode in<num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> unequal mounds on either side of a straight part.

                    <p>Sunlight dripped in her face through the little holes in the brim of her straw hat. She was walking with brisk steps too short on account of her narrow skirt; through the thin china silk the sunlight tingled like a hand stroking her back. In the heavy heat streets, stores, people in Sunday clothes, strawhats, sunshades, surfacecars, taxis, broke and crinkled brightly about her grazing her with sharp cutting glints as if she were walking through piles of metalshavings. She was groping continually through a tangle of gritty sawedged brittle noise.</p>

                    <p>At <address>Lincoln Square</address> a girl rode slowly through the traffic on a white horse; chestnut hair hung down in even faky waves over the horse's chalky rump and over the giltedged saddlecloth where in green letters pointed with crimson, read Danderine. She had on a green Dolly Varden hat with a crimson plume; <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> hand in a white gauntlet nonchalantly jiggled at the reins, in the other wabbled a goldknobbed riding crop.</p>

                    <p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> watched her pass; then she followed a smudge of green through a cross-street to the Park. A smell of trampled sunsinged grass came from boys playing baseball. All the shady benches were full of people. When she crossed the curving automobile road her sharp <nationality>French</nationality> heels sank into the asphalt. <num type="cardinal" value="2">Two</num> <occupation>sailors</occupation> were sprawling on a bench in the sun;<num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num>of them popped his lips as she passed, she could feel their seagreedy eyes cling stickily to her neck, her thighs, her ankles. She tried to keep her hips from swaying so much as she walked. The leaves were shriveled on the saplings along the path. South and east sunnyfaced buildings hemmed in the Park, to the west they were violet with shadow. Everything was itching sweaty dusty constrained by <occupation>policemen</occupation> and Sunday clothes. Why hadn't she taken the L? She was looking in the black eyes of a young man in a straw hat who was drawing up a red Stutz roadster to the curb. His eyes twinkled in hers, he jerked back his head smiling an upsidedown smile, pursing his lips so that they seemed to brush her cheek. He pulled the lever of the brake and opened the door with the other hand. She snapped her eyes away and walked on with her chin up. <num type="cardinal" value="2">Two</num> pigeons with metalgreen necks and feet of coral waddled out of her way. An old man was coaxing a squirrel to fish for peanuts in a paper bag.</p>

                    <p>All in green on a white stallion rode the Lady of the Lost Battalion. . . . Green, green, danderine . . . Godiva in the haughty mantle of her hair. . . .</p>

She climbed up onto a <address>Washington Square</address> bus. Sunday afternoon <address><num type="ordinal" value="5">Fifth</num> Avenue</address> filed by rosily dustily jerkily. On the shady side there was an occasional man in a top hat and frock coat. Sunshades, summer dresses, straw hats were bright in the sun that glinted in squares on the upper windows of houses, lay in bright slivers on the hard paint of limousines and taxicabs. It smelled of gasoline and asphalt, of spearmint and talcumpowder and perfume from the couples that jiggled closer and closer together on the seats of the bus. In an occasional storewindow, paintings, maroon draperies, varnished antique chairs behind plate glass. <placeName>The St. Regis</placeName>. <placeName>Sherry's</placeName>. The man beside her wore spats and lemon gloves, a floorwalker probably. As they passed <placeName>St. Patrick</placeName>'s she caught a whiff of incense through the tall doors open into gloom. <placeName>Delmonico's</placeName>. In front of her the young man's arm was stealing round the narrow gray flannel back of the girl beside him.</p>

The office smelled stalely of paste and manifests and men in shirt-sleeves.

                    <p>The sail of a catboat was a crimson triangle when it luffed a few feet from the concrete walk. A young man and a young girl ducked together as the slender boom swung across.

                    <p>It was almost dark; his knees were stiff from sitting still so long. As he walked wearily he could feel his potbelly cramped by his tight belt. Poor old warhorse you need a couple of drinks to think about things. A mottled beery smell came out through swinging doors. Inside the barkeep's face was like a russet apple on a snug mahogany shelf.</p>

But not so with me; gentlemen for <num type="cardinal" value="10">ten</num> years I played the market, for <num type="cardinal" value="10">ten</num> years I didn't have a ticker ribbon out of my hand day or night, and in <num type="cardinal" value="10">ten</num> years I only took a cropper <num type="cardinal" value="3">three</num> times, till the last time. Gentlemen I'm going to tell you a secret. I'm going to tell you a very important secret. . . . Charley give these very good friends of mine another round, my treat, and have a nip yourself. . . . My, that tickles her in the right place. . . . Gentlemen just another illustration of the peculiar predominance of luck in human affairs. Gentlemen the secret of my luck . . . this is exact I assure you; you can verify it yourselves in newspaper articles, magazines, speeches, lectures delivered in those days; a man, and a dirty blackguard he turned out to be eventually, even wrote a <occupation>detective</occupation> story about me called the Secret of Success, which you can find in the <placeName><settlement type="city">New York</settlement> Public Library</placeName> if you care to look the matter up. . . .

Yes you will. . . . For <num type="cardinal" value="10">ten</num> years I'm telling you I traded on margins, I bought outright, I covered on stocks I'd never even heard the name of and every time I cleaned up. I piled up money. I had <num type="cardinal" value="4">four</num> banks in the palm of my hand. I began eating my way into sugar and gutta percha, but in that I was before my time. . . . But you're getting nervous to know my secret, you think you could use it. . . . Well you <orig>couldnt</orig> . . . . It was a blue silk crocheted necktie that my mother made for me when I was a little boy. . . . <orig>Dont</orig> you laugh, God damn you. . . . No I'm not starting anything. Just another illustration of the peculiar predominance of luck. The day I chipped in with another fellow to spread  <measure type="currency"><num type="cardinal" value="1000">a thousand</num> dollars</measure> over some Louisville and Nashville on margin I wore that necktie. Soared  <num type="cardinal" value="25">twentyfive</num>  points in  <time dur-iso="PT25M"><num type="cardinal" value="25">twentyfive</num> minutes</time>. That was the beginning. Then gradually I began to notice that the times I <orig>didnt</orig> wear that necktie were the times I lost money. It got so old and ragged I tried carrying it in my pocket. <orig>Didnt</orig> do any good. I had to wear it, do you understand? . . . The rest is the old old story gentlemen. . . . There was a girl, God damn her and I loved her. I wanted to show her that there was nothing in the world I <orig> wouldnt</orig>  do for her so I gave it to her. I pretended it was a joke and laughed it off, ha ha ha. She said, Why it's no good, it's all worn out, and she threw it in the fire. . . . Only another illustration. . . . Friend you wouldn't set me up to another drink would you? I find myself unexpectedly out of funds this afternoon. . . . I thank you sir. . . . Ah that puts ginger in you again."</said></p>

                    <p>In the crammed subway car the <occupation>messenger</occupation>boy was pressed up against the back of a tall blond woman who smelled of Mary Garden. Elbows, packages, shoulders, buttocks, jiggled closer with every lurch of the screeching express. His sweaty <orgName>Western Union</orgName> cap was knocked onto the side of his head. If I could have a dame like dat, a dame like dat'd be wort havin de train stalled, de lights go out, de train wrecked. I could have her if I had de noive an de jack. As the train slowed up she fell against him, he closed his eyes, <orig>didnt</orig> breathe, his nose was mashed against her neck. The train stopped. He was carried in a rush of people out the door.</p>

                    <p>Dizzy he staggered up into the air and the blinking blocks of lights. Upper <address>Broadway</address> was full of people. Sailors lounged in twos and threes at the corner of <address><num type="ordinal" value="96">Ninetysixth</num></address>. He ate a ham and a leberwurst sandwich in a delicatessen store. The woman behind the counter had buttercolored hair like the girl in the subway but she was fatter and older. Still chewing the crust of the last sandwich he went up in the elevator to the <placeName><nationality>Japanese</nationality> Garden</placeName>. He sat thinking a while with the flicker of the screen in his eyes. Jeze dey'll tink it funny to see a <occupation>messengerboy</occupation> up here in dis suit. I better get de <distinct type="taboo">hell</distinct>outa here. I'll go deliver my telegrams.</p>

                    <p>He tightened his belt as he walked down the stairs. Then he slouched up <address>Broadway</address> to <address><num type="ordinal" value="105">105th</num> Street</address> and east towards <address>Columbus Avenue</address>, noting doors, fire escapes, windows, cornices, carefully as he went. Dis is de joint. The only lights were on the <num type="ordinal" value="2">second</num> floor. He rang the <num type="ordinal" value="2">second</num> floor bell. The doorcatch clicked. He ran up the stairs. A woman with weedy hair and a face red from leaning over the stove poked her head out.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Telegram for Santiono."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"No such name here."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sorry maam I musta rung de wrong bell."</said></p>

                    <p>Door slammed in his nose. His sallow sagging face tightened up all of a sudden. He ran lightly on tiptoe up the stairs to the top landing then up the little ladder to a trap-door. The bolt ground as he slid it back. He caught in his breath. Once on the cindergritty roof he let the trapdoor back softly into place. Chimneys stood up in alert ranks all about him, black against the glare from the streets. Crouching he stepped gingerly to the rear edge of the house, let himself down from the gutter to the fire escape. His foot grazed a flowerpot as he landed. Everything dark. Crawled through a window into a stuffy womansmelling room, slid a hand under the pillow of an unmade bed, along a bureau, spilled some facepowder, in tiny jerks pulled open the drawer, a watch, ran a pin into his finger, a brooch, something that crinkled in the back corner; bills, a roll of bills. Getaway, no chances tonight. Down the fire escape to the next floor. No light. Another window open. Takin candy from a baby. Same room, smelling of dogs and incense, some kind of dope. He could see himself faintly, fumbling, in the glass of the bureau, put his hand into a pot of cold cream, wiped it off on his pants. Hell. Something fluffysoft shot with a yell from under his feet. He stood trembling in the middle of the narrow room. The little dog was yapping loud in a corner.</p>

                    <p>The room swung into light. A girl stood in the open door, pointing a revolver at him. There was a man behind her.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What are you doing? Why it's a <orgName>Western Union</orgName> boy. . . ."</said> The light was a coppery tangle about her hair, picked out her body under the red silk kimono. The young man was wiry and brown in his unbuttoned shirt. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well what are you doing in that room?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Please maam it was hunger brought me to it, hunger an my poor ole muder starvin."</said></p>

                    <p>When he was outside the door she held out the dollarbill to him.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Jez you're white,"</said> he said choking. He grabbed the hand with the bill in it and kissed it; leaning over her hand kissing it wetly he caught a glimpse of her body under the arm in the drooping red silk sleeve. As he walked, still trembling, down the stairs, he looked back and saw the man and the girl standing side by side with their arms around each other watching him. His eyes were full of tears. He stuffed the dollarbill into his pocket.</p>

                    <p>Kid if you keep on bein a softie about women you're goin to find yourself in <orig>dat</orig> lil summer hotel up de river. . . . Pretty soft though. Whistling under his breath he walked to the L and took an uptown train. Now and then he put his hand over his back pocket to feel the roll of bills. He ran up to the <num type="ordinal" value="3">third</num> floor of an apartmenthouse that smelled of fried fish and coal gas, and rang <num type="cardinal" value="3">three</num> times at a grimy glass door. After a pause he knocked softly.</p>

                    <p>A sharpfaced woman with henna hair opened the door. She had on a fur coat over frilly lace underclothes.</p>

                    <p>Giggling they sat side by side on the edge of the bed. Through the stuffy smell of the room full of little silky bits of clothing falling off chairs a fading freshness came from a bunch of yellow roses on the bureau. Their arms tightened round each other's shoulders; suddenly he wrenched himself away and leaned over her to kiss her mouth. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Some burglar,"</said> he said breathlessly.</p>

                    <p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> gripped his hand hard as they came down the stairs stepping together. In front of the letterboxes in the shabby hallway he grabbed her suddenly by the shoulders and pressed her head back and kissed her. Hardly breathing they floated down the street toward <address>Broadway</address>. He had his hand under her arm, she squeezed it tight against her ribs with her elbow. Aloof, as if looking through thick glass into an aquarium, she watched faces, fruit in storewindows, cans of vegetables, jars of olives, redhotpokerplants in a florist's, newspapers, electric signs drifting by. When they passed cross-streets a puff of air came in her face off the river. Sudden jetbright glances of eyes under straw hats, attitudes of chins, thin lips, pouting lips, Cupid's bows, hungry shadow under cheekbones, faces of girls and young men nuzzled fluttering against her like moths as she walked with her stride even to his through the tingling yellow night.</p>

                    <p>Somewhere they sat down at a table. An orchestra throbbed. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"No <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</persName></addName></persName> I <orig>cant</orig> drink anything. . . .

                    <p><persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName> was bubbling drunk. <said who="#StanwoodEmery" aloud="true" direct="true">"I wish earth had thy body as fruit to eat,"</said> he kept repeating. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> was all the time twisting about bits of rubbery cold Welsh rabbit with her fork. She had started to drop with a lurching drop like a rollercoaster's into shuddering pits of misery. In a square place in the middle of the floor <num type="cardinal" value="4">four</num> couples were dancing the tango. She got to her feet.</p>

                    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName> I'm going home.

                    <p>He nodded and poured himself another highball. She stood behind his chair <time dur-iso="PT1S">a second</time> looking down at his long head of close ruffled hair. He was spouting verses softly to himself. <said who="#StanwoodEmery" aloud="true" direct="true">"Saw the white implacable Aphrodite, damn fine, Saw the hair unbound and the feet unsandaled, Jiminy. . . .

                    <p>Once out on <address>Broadway</address> again she felt very merry. She stood in the middle of the street waiting for the uptown car. An occasional taxi whizzed by her. From the <geogFeat>river</geogFeat> on the warm wind came the long moan of a steamboat whistle. In the pit inside her <num type="cardinal" value="1000">thousands</num> of gnomes were building tall brittle glittering towers. The car swooped ringing along the rails, stopped. As she climbed in she remembered swooningly the smell of <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName>'s body sweating in her arms. She let herself drop into a seat, biting her lips to keep from crying out. God it's terrible to be in love. Opposite <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> men with chinless bluefish faces were talking hilariously, slapping fat knees.</p>

A fetor of mattresses and sleep seeped out from the blocks of narrow-windowed houses. Along the gutters garbagecans stank sourly. In the shadow of a doorway a man and girl swayed tightly clamped in each other's arms. Saying good night. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> smiled happily. Greatest hit on <address>Broadway</address>. The words were an elevator carrying her up dizzily, up into some stately height where electric light signs crackled scarlet and gold and green, where were bright roofgardens that smelled of orchids, and the slow throb of a tango danced in a goldgreen dress with <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName> while handclapping of millions beat in gusts like a hailstorm about them. Greatest hit on <address>Broadway</address>.</p>

                    <p>She was walking up the scaling white stairs. Before the door marked <persName><forename>Sunderland</forename></persName> a feeling of sick disgust suddenly choked her. She stood a long time her heart pounding with the key poised before the lock. Then with a jerk she pushed the key in the lock and opened the door.</p>

It was a shriek. <persName><roleName type="honorific">Miss</roleName> <surname>Costello</surname></persName> wanted the <persName><surname>Oglethorpes</surname></persName> thrown out at dawn and said she'd leave if they didn't and <persName><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Sunderland</surname></persName> kept moaning that in <num type="cardinal" value="30">thirty</num> years of theatrical experience she'd never seen a scene like that, and the man in the dress suit who was <persName><forename>Benjamin</forename> <surname>Arden</surname></persName> . . . you know he played a character part in <title>Honeysuckle</title> <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jim</addName></persName>. . . said he thought people like <persName ref="#TonyHunter"><forename>Tony</forename> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName> ought to be in jail. When I went to bed it was still going on. Do you wonder that I slept late after all that and kept you waiting, poor child, <time dur-iso="PT1H">an hour</time> in the <placeName>Times Drug Store</placeName>?"</said></p>

                    <p><persName ref="#JoeHarland"><forename>Joe</forename> <surname>Harland</surname></persName> stood in his hall bedroom with his hands in his pockets staring at the picture of <title>The Stag at Bay</title>T that hung crooked in the middle of the verdegris wall that hemmed in the shaky iron bed. His clawcold fingers moved restlessly in the bottoms of his trousers pockets. He was talking aloud in a low even voice: <said who="#JoeHarland" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh, it's all luck you know, but that's the last time I try the <persName><surname>Merivales</surname></persName>. <persName ref="#EmilyMerivale"><forename>Emily</forename></persName>'d have given it to me if it hadn't been for that damned old tightwad.

It's luck that's all it is, and Lord knows they used to eat out of my hand in the old days."</said> His rising voice grated on his ears. He pressed his lips together. <said who="#JoeHarland" aloud="false" direct="true">You're getting batty old man</said>. He stepped back and forth in the narrow space between the bed and the wall. <num type="cardinal" value="3">Three</num> steps. <num type="cardinal" value="3">Three</num> steps. He went to the washstand and drank out of the pitcher. The water tasted of rank wood and sloppails. He spat the last mouthful back. I need a good tenderloin steak not water. He pounded his clenched fists together. I got to do something. I got to do something.</p>

                    <p>He put on his overcoat to hide the rip in the seat of his trousers. The frayed sleeves tickled his wrists. The dark stairs creaked. He was so weak he kept grabbing the rail for fear of falling. The old woman pounced out of a door on him in the lower hall. The rat had squirmed sideways on her head as if trying to escape from under the thin gray pompadour.</p>

                    <p><persName><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mrs.</roleName> <forename>Budkowitz</forename></persName> began to jerk her shoulders about. Her voice rose thin and wailing like the sound of a peanut wagon.</p>

                    <p>At the corner of <address><num type="ordinal" value="3">Third</num> Avenue</address> he stopped and stood shivering in the hot afternoon sunlight, sweat running down behind his ears. He was too weak to swear. Jagged oblongs of harsh sound broke<num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> after another over his head as an elevated past over. Trucks grated by along the avenue raising a dust that smelled of gasoline and trampled horsedung. The dead air stank of stores and lunchrooms. He began walking slowly uptown towards <address><num type="ordinal" value="14">Fourteenth</num> Street</address>. At a corner a crinkly warm smell of cigars stopped him like a hand on his shoulder. He stood a while looking in the little shop watching the slim stained fingers of the cigarroller shuffle the brittle outside leaves of tobacco. Remembering <title>Romeo and Juliet</title> Arguelles Morales he sniffed deeply. The slick tearing of tinfoil, the careful slipping off of the band, the tiny ivory penknife for the end that slit delicately as flesh, the smell of the wax match, the long inhaling of bitter crinkled deep sweet smoke. And now sir about this little matter of the new Northern Pacific bond issue. . . . He clenched his fists in the clammy pockets of his raincoat. <said who="#JoeHarland" aloud="false" direct="true">Take my key would she the old harridan?

                    <p>He walked west along <address><num type="ordinal" value="14">Fourteenth</num></address> and without stopping to think and lose his nerve went down into a small basement stationery store, strode through unsteadily to the back, and stood swaying in the doorway of a little office where sat at a rolltop desk a blueeyed baldheaded fat man.</p>

                    <p><persName ref="#Felsius"><forename>Felsius</forename></persName> nodded. His fingers fat as sausages were tapping uneasily on the edge of the desk.</p>

                    <p><persName ref="#Felsius"><forename>Felsius</forename></persName> moved back against the wall as if to ward off a blow. He held out a <measure type="currency"><num type="cardinal" value="50">fifty</num>cent</measure> piece on thick trembling fingers. <persName ref="#JoeHarland"><surname>Harland</surname></persName> took it, turned without a word and stumbled out through the shop. <persName ref="#Felsius"><forename>Felsius</forename></persName> pulled a violet bordered handkerchief out of his pocket, mopped his brow and turned to his letters again.</p>

                    <p>They came out of the movie blinking into bright pools of electric glare. <persName ref="#CassandraWilkins"><addName type="nickname">Cassie</addName></persName> watched him stand with his feet apart and eyes absorbed lighting a cigar. <persName ref="#MorrisMcAvoy"><surname>McAvoy</surname></persName> was a stocky man with a beefy neck; he wore a single-button coat, a checked vest and a dogshead pin in his brocade necktie.</p>

                    <p><said who="#MorrisMcAvoy" aloud="true" direct="true">"That was a rotton show or I'm a Dutchman,"</said> he was growling.</p>

                    <p>At <address>Columbus Circle</address> they went into a drugstore.

                    <p>The path between round splashes of arclights ducked into darkness. Through slant lights and nudging shadows came a smell of dusty leaves and trampled grass and occasionally a rift of cool fragrance from damp earth under shrubberies.</p>

                    <p><said who="#CassandraWilkins" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh I love it in the Park,"</said> chanted <persName ref="#CassandraWilkins"><addName type="nickname">Cassie</addName></persName>.

                    <p><persName ref="#MorrisMcAvoy"><forename>Morris</forename></persName> said nothing.

                    <p><said who="#CassandraWilkins" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh <persName ref="#MorrisMcAvoy"><forename>Morris</forename></persName> wouldn't it be wonderful? Where'd we live? On <placeName>Central Park South</placeName>."</said> They stood looking back at the glow of electric signs that came from <address>Columbus Circle</address>. To the left they could see curtained lights in the windows of a whitefaced apartmenthouse. He looked stealthily to the right and left and then kissed her. She twisted her mouth out from under his.</p>

                    <p><said who="#CassandraWilkins" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Dont</orig>. . . . Somebody might see us,"</said> she whispered breathless.

                    <p><said who="#MorrisMcAvoy" aloud="true" direct="true">"What did he say?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#MorrisMcAvoy" aloud="true" direct="true">"That's the trouble with you, you'll never make good, you're too upstage."</said> She looked up at him with streaming eyes that glistened in the white powdery light of an arclamp.</p>

They were on a little hill of granite outcrop with shrubbery all round. The lights from the buildings that hemmed in the end of the Park shone in their faces. They stood apart holding each other's hands.</p>

                    <p><said who="#MorrisMcAvoy" aloud="true" direct="true">"Take that redhaired girl up at <address><num type="ordinal" value="105">105th</num> Street</address>. . . . I bet she <orig> wouldnt</orig> be upstage when she was alone with a feller."</said></p>

                    <p>He pulled her to him roughly, pressed her to him hard with his spread hands on her back. She felt her legs tremble and go weak. She was falling through colored shafts of faintness. His mouth <orig>wouldnt</orig> let her catch her breath.</p>

                    <p><said who="#MorrisMcAvoy" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look out,"</said> he whispered pulling himself away from her. They walked on unsteadily down the path through the shrubbery. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I guess it aint."</said></p>

                    <p>They sat down on a bench in the light. Behind them automobiles slithered with a constant hissing scuttle in <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> streams along the roadway. She put her hand on his knee and he covered it with his big stubby hand.</p></p>

Gradually she let her head fall on his shoulder. <said who="#CassandraWilkins" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh I <orig>dont</orig> care,"</said> she whispered with dry lips. Behind them limousines, roadsters, touringcars, sedans, slithered along the roadway with snaky glint of lights running in <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> smooth continuous streams.</p>

                    <p>The brown serge smelled of mothballs as she folded it. She stooped to lay it in the trunk; a layer of tissuepaper below rustled when she smoothed the wrinkles with her hand. The <num type="ordinal" value="1">first</num> violet morning light outside the window was making the electriclight bulb grow red like a sleepless eye. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> straightened herself suddenly and stood stiff with her arms at her sides, her face flushed pink. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's just too low,"</said> she said. She spread a towel over the dresses and piled brushes, a handmirror, slippers, chemises, boxes of powder in pellmell on top of them. Then she slammed down the lid of the trunk, locked it and put the key in her flat alligatorskin purse. She stood looking dazedly about the room sucking a broken fingernail. Yellow sunlight was obliquely drenching the chimneypots and cornices of the houses across the street. She found herself staring at the white E.T.O. at the end of her trunk. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's all too terribly disgustingly low,"</said> she said again. Then she grabbed a nailfile off the bureau and scratched out the O. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Whee,"</said> she whispered and snapped her fingers. After she had put on a little bucketshaped black hat and a veil, so that people wouldn't see she'd been crying, she piled a lot of books, <title>Youth's Encounter</title>, <title>Thus Spoke Zarathustra</title>, <title>The Golden Ass</title>, <title>Imaginary Conversations</title>, <title>Aphrodite</title>, <title><foreign xml:lang="fr">Chansons de Bilitis</foreign></title> and <title>the Oxford Book of <nationality>French</nationality> Verse</title> in a silk shawl and tied them together.</p>



                    <p>There was a faint tapping at the door. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Who's that,"</said> she whispered.</p>

                    <p><said who="#CassandraWilkins" aloud="true" direct="true">"It just me,"</said> came a tearful voice.</p>

                    <p>She found the <occupation>taxi driver</occupation>in the hall looking at the names above the pushbuttons. He went up to fetch her trunk. She settled herself happily on the dusty buff seat of the taxi, taking deep breaths of the riversmelling morning air. The <occupation>taxi driver</occupation> smiled roundly at her when he had let the trunk slide off his back onto the dashboard.</p>

                    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Pretty heavy, miss."</said></p>

                    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"It's a shame you had to carry it all alone."</said></p>

                    <p>When he leaned to crank the car the man pushed his hat back on his head letting ruddy curly hair out over his eyes. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right I'll take you anywhere you like,"</said> he said as he hopped into his seat in the jiggling car. When they turned down into the very empty sunlight of <address>Broadway</address> a feeling of happiness began to sizzle and soar like rockets inside her. The air beat fresh, thrilling in her face. The <occupation>taxi driver</occupation>talked back at her through the open window.</p>

                    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"I thought yous was catchin a train to go away somewhere, miss."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm going away from my husband."</said> The words popped out of her mouth before she could stop them.</p>

                    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"No I <orig>cant</orig> say he did that,"</said> she said laughing.</p>

                    <p><address><num type="ordinal" value="5">Fifth</num> Avenue</address> was white and empty and swept by a sparkling wind. The trees in <address>Madison Square</address> were unexpectedly bright green like ferns in a dun room. At the <placeName>Brevoort</placeName> a sleepy <nationality>French</nationality> <occupation>nightporter</occupation> carried her baggage. In the low whitepainted room the sunlight drowsed on a faded crimson armchair. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> ran about the room like a small child kicking her heels and clapping her hands. With pursed lips and tilted head she arranged her toilet things on the bureau. Then she hung her yellow nightgown on a chair and undressed, caught sight of herself in the mirror, stood naked looking at herself with her hands on her tiny firm appleshaped breasts.</p>

                    <p>She pulled on her nightgown and went to the phone. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Please send up a pot of chocolate and rolls to <num type="cardinal" value="108">108</num> . . . as soon as you can please."</said> Then she got into bed. She lay laughing with her legs stretched wide in the cool slippery sheets.</p>

                    <p>Hairpins were sticking into her head. She sat up and pulled them all out and shook the heavy coil of her hair down about her shoulders. She drew her knees up to her chin and sat thinking. From the street she could hear the occasional rumble of a truck. In the kitchens below her room a sound of clattering had begun. From all around came a growing rumble of traffic beginning. She felt hungry and alone. The bed was a raft on which she was marooned alone, always alone, afloat on a growling ocean. A shudder went down her spine. She drew her knees up closer to her chin.</p>

The gutted lunchroom was silent under the sparse glower of <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> bulbs hanging over the counter where remained a few pies under a bellglass, and a man in a white coat nodding on a tall stool. Now and then the eyes in his gray doughy face flicked open and he grunted and looked about. At the last table over were the hunched shoulders of men asleep, faces crumpled like old newspapers pillowed on arms. <persName ref="#JoeHarland"><forename>Joe</forename> <surname>Harland</surname></persName> sat up straight and yawned. A woman blobby under a raincoat with a face red and purplish streaked like rancid meat was asking for a cup of coffee at the counter.

                    <p><persName ref="#JoeHarland"><forename>Harland</forename></persName> could smell her whiskey breath as she sobbed. He raised his head and stared at her. She twisted her flabby mouth into a smile and bobbed her head towards him.</p>

                    <p>Some strands of gray hair with traces of henna at the tips had fallen down about her face. The man in the white coat walked over to the table.</p>

                    <p><persName ref="#JoeHarland"><forename>Joe</forename> <surname>Harland</surname></persName> shoved his face into the hollow of his arm again and tried to go to sleep. He heard the plate set down followed by her toothless nibbling and an occasional sucking noise when she drank the coffee. A new customer had come in and was talking across the counter in a low growling voice.</p>

                    <p>She stooped and fumbled for her hat on the floor. She sat sobbing rubbing her swollen redgrimed knuckles into her eyes.</p>

The curve of <persName ref="#HarryGoldweiser"><forename>Harry</forename> <surname>Goldweiser</surname></persName>'s nose merges directly into the curve of his bald forehead, his big rump bulges over the edges of a triangular gilt stool, his small brown eyes measure her face like antennae as he talks to her. A woman nearby smells of sandalwood. A woman with orange lips and a chalk face under an orange turban passes talking to a man with a pointed beard. A hawk-beaked woman with crimson hair puts her hand on a man's shoulder from behind. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why how do you do, <persName><roleName type="honorific">Miss</roleName> <surname>Cruikshank</surname></persName>; it's surprising isn't it how everybody in the world is always at the same place at the same time."</said> <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> sits in the armchair drowsily listening, coolness of powder on her face and arms, fatness of rouge on her lips, her body just bathed fresh as a violet under the silk dress, under the silk underclothes; she sits dreamily, drowsily listening. A sudden twinge of men's voices knotting about her. She sits up cold white out of reach like a lighthouse. Men's hands crawl like bugs on the unbreakable glass. Men's looks blunder and flutter against it helpless as moths. But in deep pitblackness inside something clangs like a fire engine.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You brute to refer to that. . . . Oh it's horrible!"</said></p>

                    <p>The maid came in from the pantry with bacon and eggs on a tray. They sat silent looking at each other. The maid swished out of the room and closed the door. <persName ref="#CecilyBaldwin"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> put her forehead down on the edge of the table and began to cry. <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>sat staring at the headlines in the paper.

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Poor old <persName ref="#CecilyBaldwin"><forename>Cecily</forname></persName>,"</said> he said.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Dont</orig> touch me."</said></p>

                    <p>She ran out of the room with her handkerchief to her face. He sat down, helped himself to bacon and eggs and toast and began to eat; everything tasted like paper. He stopped eating to scribble a note on a scratchpad he kept in his breast pocket behind his handkerchief: See Collins vs. Arbuthnot, N.Y.S.C. Appel. Div.</p>

                    <p>The sound of a step in the hall outside caught his ear, the click of a latch. The elevator had just gone down. He ran <num type="cardinal" value="4">four</num> flights down the steps. Through the glass and wroughtiron doors of the vestibule downstairs he caught sight of her on the curb, standing tall and stiff, pulling on her gloves. He rushed out and took her by the hand just as a taxi drove up. Sweat beaded on his forehead and was prickly under his collar. He could see himself standing there with the napkin ridiculous in his hand and the colored doorman grinning and saying, "Good mornin, <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>, looks like it going to be a fine day." Gripping her hand tight, he said in a low voice through his teeth:</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#CecilyBaldwin"><forename>Cecily</forname></persName> there's something I want to talk to you about. <orig>Wont</orig> you wait <time dur-iso="PT1M">a minute</time> and we'll go downtown together? . . . Wait about <num type="cardinal" value="5">five</num> minutes please,"</said> he said to the taxi-driver. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"We'll be right down."</said> Squeezing her wrist hard he walked back with her to the elevator. When they stood in the hall of their own apartment, she suddenly looked him straight in the face with dry blazing eyes.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Come in here <persName ref="#CecilyBaldwin"><forename>Cecily</forname></persName>"</said> he said gently. He closed their bedroom door and locked it. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Now lets talk this over quietly. Sit down dear."</said> He put a chair behind her. She sat down suddenly stiffly like a marionette.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Now look here <persName ref="#CecilyBaldwin"><forename>Cecily</forname></persName> you have no right to talk the way you do about my friends. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mrs.</roleName> <surname type="married">Oglethorpe</surname></persName> is a friend of mine.

You <orig>cant</orig> go on giving away to your insane jealousy like this. I allow you complete liberty and trust you absolutely. I think I have the right to expect the same confidence from you. . . . <persName ref="#CecilyBaldwin"><forename>Cecily</forname></persName> do be my sensible little girl again.

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look here <persName ref="#CecilyBaldwin"><forename>Cecily</forname></persName> a divorce would be very harmful to my situation downtown just at the moment, but if you really <orig>dont</orig> want to go on living with me I'll see what I can arrange. . . . But in any event you must have more confidence in me. You know I'm fond of you. And for God's sake <orig>dont</orig> go to see anybody about it without consulting me. You <orig>dont</orig> want a scandal and headlines in the papers, do you?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right . . . leave me alone. . . . I <orig>dont</orig> care about anything."</said></p>

                    <p>She shook her head. He kissed her on the forehead, took his straw hat and stick in the hall and hurried out.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh I'm the most miserable woman,"</said> she groaned and got to her feet. Her head ached as if it were bound with hot wire. She went to the window and leaned out into the sunlight. <address>Across Park Avenue</address> the flameblue sky was barred with the red girder cage of a new building. Steam riveters rattled incessantly; now and then a donkeyengine whistled and there was a jingle of chains and a fresh girder soared crosswise in the air. Men in blue overalls moved about the scaffolding. Beyond to the northwest a shining head of clouds soared blooming compactly like a cauliflower. Oh if it would only rain. As the thought came to her there was a low growl of thunder above the din of building and of traffic. Oh if it would only rain.</p>



                    <p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> had just hung a chintz curtain in the window to hide with its blotchy pattern of red and purple flowers the vista of desert backyards and brick flanks of downtown houses. In the middle of the bare room was a boxcouch cumbered with teacups, a copper chafingdish and percolator; the yellow hardwood floor was littered with snippings of chintz and curtainpins; books, dresses, bedlinen cascaded from a trunk in the corner; from a new mop in the fireplace exuded a smell of cedar oil. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> was leaning against the wall in a daffodilcolored kimono looking happily about the big shoebox-shaped room when the buzzer startled her. She pushed a rope of hair up off her forehead and pressed the button that worked the latch. There was a little knock on the door. A woman was standing in the dark of the hall.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why don't you get married?"</said></p>

                    <p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName>'s hands were cold. She went to the window and looked out. A little boy in a cowboy suit was running about the yard waving an end of clothesline. He tripped and fell. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> could see his face puckered with tears as he got to his feet again.

                    <p><persName ref="#JoeHarland"><forename>Joe</forename> <surname>Harland</surname></persName>, puffing on his pipe, pulled to and bolted the wide quaking board gates. A last splash of garnetcolored sunlight was fading on the tall housewall across the excavation. Blue arms of cranes stood out dark against it. <persName ref="#JoeHarland"><surname>Harland</surname></persName>'s pipe had gone out, he stood puffing at it with his back to the gate looking at the files of empty wheelbarrows, the piles of picks and shovels, the little shed for the donkey-engine and the steam drills that sat perched on a split rock like a mountaineer's shack. It seemed to him peaceful in spite of the rasp of traffic from the street that seeped through the hoarding. He went into the leanto by the gate where the telephone was, sat down in the chair, knocked out, filled and lit his pipe and spread the newspaper out on his knees. Contractors Plan Lockout to Answer Builders' Strike. He yawned and threw back his head. The light was too blue-dim to read. He sat a long time staring at the stub scarred toes of his boots. His mind was a fuzzy comfortable blank. Suddenly he saw himself in a dress-suit wearing a top hat with an orchid in his buttonhole. The Wizard of <orgName>Wall Street</orgName> looked at the lined red face and the gray hair under the mangy cap and the big hands with their grimy swollen knuckles and faded with a snicker. He remembered faintly the smell of a Corona-Corona as he reached into the pocket of the peajacket for a can of Prince Albert to refill his pipe. "What dif does it make I'd like to know?" he said aloud. When he lit a match the night went suddenly inky all round. He blew out the match. His pipe was a tiny genial red volcano that made a discreet cluck each time he pulled on it. He smoked very slowly inhaling deep. The tall buildings all round were haloed with ruddy glare from streets and electriclight signs. Looking straight up through glimmering veils of reflected light he could see the blueblack sky and stars. The tobacco was sweet. He was very happy.</p>

                    <p>A glowing cigarend crossed the door of the shack. <persName ref="#JoeHarland"><forename>Harland</forename></persName> grabbed his lantern and went out.

They would just be getting out of the theaters, men in eveningclothes, girls in lowneck dresses; men were going home to their wives and mistresses; the city was going to bed. Taxis honked and rasped outside the hoarding, the sky shimmered with gold powder from electric signs. He dropped the butt of the cigar and crushed it on the floor with his heel.

He had come to the death of Olivier in Jean Christophe and read with tightening gullet. In his memory lingered the sound of the Rhine swirling, restlessly gnawing the foot of the garden of the house where Jean Christophe was born. <placeName><bloc type="continent">Europe</block></placeName> was a green park in his mind full of music and red flags and mobs marching. Occasionally the sound of a steamboat whistle from the <geogFeat>river</geogFeat> settled breathless snowysoft into the room. From the street came a rattle of taxis and the whining sound of streetcars.</p>

                    <p>There was a knock at the door.<persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> got up, his eyes blurred and hot from reading.</p>

                    <p><persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> gathered up his book and went into his bedroom and undressed. His watch said <num type="cardinal" value="15">fifteen</num> past twelve. The night was sultry. When he had turned out the light he sat a long while on the edge of the bed. The faraway sounds of sirens from the <geogFeat>river</geogFeat> gave him gooseflesh. From the street he heard footsteps, the sound of men and women's voices, low youthful laughs of people going home <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> by two. A phonograph was playing Secondhand Rose. He lay on his back on top of the sheet. There came on the air through the window a sourness of garbage, a smell of burnt gasoline and traffic and dusty pavements, a huddled stuffiness of pigeonhole rooms where men and women's bodies writhed alone tortured by the night and the young summer. He lay with seared eyeballs staring at the ceiling, his body glowed in a brittle shivering agony like redhot metal.</p>

                    <p>A woman's voice whispering eagerly woke him; someone was pushing open the door. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I <orig>wont</orig> see him.

                    <p><persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName> had sat down on the edge of the bed shaking with laughter. He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

In a last spasm of laughing he fell off the edge of the bed and rolled on the floor. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> went to the window and looked down the fire escape into the alley. <persName ref="#JohnOglethorpe"><surname>Oglethorpe </surname></persName> had gone. It was raining hard. A smell of wet bricks rose from the housewalls.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well if this <orig>isnt</orig> the <distinct type="informal">darnedest</distinct> fool business?"</said> He walked back into his room without looking at <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName>.

                    <p>His hands were cold and trembling. He pulled a blanket up over him. He lay listening to the steady beat of the rain and the hissing spatter of a gutter. Now and then a puff of wind blew a faint cool spray in his face. There still lingered in the room a frail cedarwood gruff smell of her heavycoiled hair, a silkiness of her body where she had crouched wrapped in the sheet hiding.</p>



                    <p><persName ref="#EdThatcher"><forename>Ed</forename> <surname>Thatcher</surname></persName> sat in his bay window among the Sunday papers. His hair was grizzled and there were deep folds in his cheeks. The upper buttons of his pongee trousers were undone to ease his sudden little potbelly. He sat in the open window looking out over the blistering asphalt at the endless stream of automobiles that whirred in either direction past the yellowbrick row of stores and the redbrick station under the eaves of which on a black ground gold letters glinted feebly in the sun: Passaic. Apartments round about emitted a querulous Sunday grinding of phonographs playing <title>It's a Bear</title>. The Sextette from Lucia, selections from The Quaker Girl. On his knees lay the theatrical section of the <title>New York Times</title>. He looked out with bleared eyes into the quivering heat feeling his ribs tighten with a breathless ache. He had just read a paragraph in a marked copy of <title>Town Topics</title>.</p>

                    <p>Malicious tongues are set wagging by the undeniable fact that young <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><forename>Stanwood</forename> <surname>Emery</surname></persName>'s car is seen standing every night outside the Knickerbocker Theatre and never does it leave they say, without a certain charming young <occupation>actress</occupation> whose career is fast approaching stellar magnitude. This same young gentleman, whose father is the head of <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> of the city's most respected lawfirms, who recently left Harvard under slightly unfortunate circumstances, has been astonishing the natives for some time with his exploits which we are sure are merely the result of the ebullience of boyish spirits. A word to the wise.</p>

                    <p>The bell rang <num type="cardinal" value="3">three</num> times. <persName ref="#EdThatcher"><forename>Ed</forename> <surname>Thatcher</surname></persName> dropped his papers and hurried quaking to the door. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> you're so late.

                    <p>They were silent. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> leaned over to breathe deep of the roses. She watched a little green measuring worm cross a bronzed leaf.</p>

                    <p><persName ref="#EdThatcher"><surname>Thatcher</surname></persName> cleared his throat and turned his face away from her to look out the window at the <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> endless bands of automobiles that passed along the road in front of the station. Dust rose from them and angular glitter of glass enamel and nickel. Tires made a swish on the oily macadam. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> dropped onto the davenport and let her eyes wander among the faded red roses of the carpet.</p>

                    <p>The bell rang. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'll go daddy. . . . How do you do <persName><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mrs.</roleName> Culveteer</persName>?"</said></p>

                    <p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> kept looking at the floor so as not to catch her father's eye.

                    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"That was quite a line about the temptations of stage life,"</said> said <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> with a little laugh in her throat. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Come along or the place'll be crowded.

                    <p>Said Thatcher in a peevish crackling voice, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Let's not dawdle around."</said></p>

                    <p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> spread out her sunshade as they stepped out of the door flanked on either side by bells and letterboxes. A blast of gray heat beat in their faces. They passed the stationery store, the red A. and P., the corner drugstore from which a stale coolness of sodawater and icecream freezers drifted out under the green awning, crossed the street, where their feet sank into the sticky melting asphalt, and stopped at the Sagamore Cafeteria. It was  <num type="cardinal" value="12">twelve</num> exactly by the clock in the window that had round its face in old <nationality>English</nationality> lettering, Time to Eat. Under it was a large rusty fern and a card announcing Chicken Dinner $1.25. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> lingered in the doorway looking up the quivering street. "Look daddy we'll probably have a thunderstorm." A cumulus soared in unbelievable snowy contours in the slate sky. "<orig>Isnt</orig> that a fine cloud? Wouldnt it be fine if we had a riproaring thunderstorm?"</p>

                    <p><persName ref="#EdThatcher"><forename>Ed</forename> <surname>Thatcher</surname></persName> looked up, shook his head and went in through the swinging screen door. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> followed him.

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"How do you do <persName ref="#EdThatcher"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Thatcher</surname></persName>?

                    <epigraph>
                    <p>Such afternoons the buses are crowded into line like elephants in a circusparade. Morningside Heights to <address>Washington Square</address>, Penn Station to Grant's Tomb. Parlorsnakes and flappers joggle hugging downtown uptown, hug joggling gray square after gray square, until they see the new moon giggling over Weehawken and feel the gusty wind of a dead Sunday blowing dust in their faces, dust of a typsy twilight.</p>
                    </epigraph>


                    <p>THEY are walking up the Mall in <placeName>Central Park</placeName>.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Looks like he had a boil on his neck,"</said> says <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> in front of the statue of Burns.</p>

                    <p>She is walking in her wide hat in her pale loose dress that the wind now and then presses against her legs and arms, silkily, swishily walking in the middle of great rosy and purple and pistachiogreen bubbles of twilight that swell out of the grass and trees and ponds, bulge against the tall houses sharp gray as dead teeth round the southern end of the park, melt into the indigo zenith. When he talks, forming sentences roundly with his thick lips, continually measuring her face with his brown eyes, she feels his words press against her body, nudge in the hollows where her dress clings; she can hardly breathe for fear of listening to him.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<title>The Zinnia Girl</title>'s going to be an absolute knockout, <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Elaine</addName></persName>, I'm telling you and that part's just written for you, I'd enjoy working with you again, honest. . . .

When I was a young fellow I was different, but what are you to do? I had to make money and make my way in the world. And so I've gone on year after year. For the <num type="ordinal" value="1">first</num> time I'm glad I did it, that I shoved ahead and made big money, because now I can offer it all to you. Understand what I mean? . . . All those ideels and beautiful things pushed down into myself when I was making my way in a man's world were like planting seed and you're their flower."</said></p>

                    <p>Now and then as they walk the back of his hand brushes against hers; she clenches her fist sullenly drawing it away from the hot determined pudginess of his hand.</p>

                    <p>The Mall is full of couples, families waiting for the music to begin. It smells of children and dress-shields and talcum powder. A <occupation>balloonman</occupation> passes them trailing red and yellow and pink balloons like a great inverted bunch of grapes behind him. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh buy me a balloon."</said> The words are out of her mouth before she can stop them.</p>

                    <p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> sits numb at a table on the terrace of the Casino. A hot gust of foodsmell and the rhythm of a band playing He's a Ragpicker swirls chokingly about her; now and then she butters a scrap of roll and puts it in her mouth. She feels very helpless, caught like a fly in his sticky trickling sentences.</p>

The orchestra is playing a tango.</p>

                    <p>The sun streaming into the office under the drawn shades cut a bright slanting layer like watered silk through the cigarsmoke.</p>

                    <p>Outside in the shiny marble hall, <persName ref="#JoeOKeefee"><forename>Joe</forename> <surname>O'Keefe</surname></persName> was whistling Sweet Rosy O'Grady waiting for the elevator. Imagine a guy havin a knockout like that for a secretary. He stopped whistling and let the breath out silently through pursed lips. In the elevator he greeted a walleyed man in a check suit. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hullo Buck."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Been on your vacation yet?"</said></p>

                    <p><persName ref="#JoeHarland"><forename>Joe</forename></persName> stood with his feet apart and his hands in his pockets. He shook his head. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I get off Saturday."</said></p>

                    <p>Coming out of the building <persName ref="#JoeOKeefee"><surname>O'Keefe</surname></persName> had to make his way through people crowding into the portal. A slate sky sagging between the tall buildings was spatting the pavements with <measure type="currency"><num type="cardinal" value="50">fifty</num> cent</measure> pieces. Men were running to cover with their straw hats under their coats. <num type="cardinal" value="2">Two</num> girls had made hoods of newspaper over their summer bonnets. He snatched blue of their eyes, a glint of lips and teeth as he passed. He walked fast to the corner and caught an uptown car on the run. The rain advanced down the street in a solid sheet glimmering, swishing, beating newspapers flat, prancing in silver nipples along the asphalt, striping windows, putting shine on the paint of streetcars and taxicabs. Above Fourteenth there was no rain, the air was sultry.</p>

                    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"A funny thing weather,"</said> said an old man next to him. <persName ref="#JoeOKeefee"><surname>O'Keefe</surname></persName> grunted. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"When I was a boy onct I saw it rain on <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> side of the street an a house was struck by lightnin an on our side not a drop fell though the old man wanted it bad for some tomatoplants he'd just set out."</said></p>

He jumped off the car; the momentum carried him in little running steps to the curb. Turning his coatcollar down again he started across the square. On the end of a bench under a tree drowsed <persName ref="#JoeHarland"><forename>Joe</forename> <surname>Harland</surname></persName>. <persName ref="#JoeOKeefee"><surname>O'Keefe</surname></persName> plunked down in the seat beside him.</p>

                    <p><persName ref="#JoeHarland"><forename>Joe</forename> <surname>Harland</surname></persName> watched the young man's short jerky stride as he went off down the path with his straw hat on the side of his head. Then he got to his feet and walked east along <address><num type="ordinal" value="23">Twentythird</num> Street</address>, The pavements and housewalls still gave off heat although the sun had set. He stopped outside a corner saloon and examined carefully a group of stuffed ermines, gray with dust, that occupied the center of the window. Through the swinging doors a sound of quiet voices and a malty coolness seeped into the street. He suddenly flushed and bit his upper lip and after a furtive glance up and down the street went in through the swinging doors and shambled up to the brassy bottleglittering bar.</p>

                    <p>After the rain outdoors the plastery backstage smell was pungent in their nostrils. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> hung the wet raincoat on the back of the door and put her umbrella in a corner of the dressing room where a little puddle began to spread from it. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"And all I could think of,"</said> she was saying in a low voice to <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName> who followed her staggering, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"was a funny song somebody'd told me when I was a little girl about: And the only man who survived the flood was longlegged <persName ref="#JackCunningham"><forename>Jack</forename></persName> of the Isthmus."</said></p>

                    <p>There was a soft doubleknock at the door. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Come in Milly."</said> Milly was a small wrinklefaced woman with black eyes. A touch of negro blood made her purplegray lips thick, gave a lividness to her verywhite skin.</p>

                    <p>Sitting in front of the mirror at her dressingtable <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> was wiping cold cream off her face with quick dabs of a little towel.

                    <p>Milly was rolling her eyes and shaking her head as she wrung out <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName>'s coat.

Still he was impressed by the writeups the Herald and World gave me Sunday. . . . Goodnight Barney, nasty night. . . . My God. . . . Here's a taxi, get in. Where are you going?"</said> Out of the dark of the taxi, out of his long face muffled in the blue hood, his eyes were so bright black they frightened her like coming suddenly on a deep pit in the dark.</p>

Suddenly <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName> leaned over her and kissed her hard very quickly on the mouth.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName> you've got to stop drinking. It's getting beyond a joke."</said></p>

                    <p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> paid the taxi. Siren throbbing in an upward shriek that burst and trailed in a dull wail down the street, a fire engine went by red and gleaming, then a hookandladder with bell clanging.</p>

                    <p><said who="#StanwoodEmery" aloud="true" direct="true">"Let's go to the fire <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName>."</said></p>

                    <p>He followed her silent into the house and up the stairs. Her long room was cool and fresh smelling.</p>

                    <p>She undid the sodden bundle of his clothes and took them into the kitchenette to dry beside the gas stove. The sound of the phonograph playing He's a devil in his own home town called her back. <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName>had taken off the dress. He was dancing round with a chair for a partner, her blue padded dressingown flying out from his thin hairy legs.</p>

                    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName> you precious idiot."</said></p>

                    <p>He put down the chair and came towards her brown and male and lean in the silly dressingown. The phonograph came to the end of the tune and the record went on rasping round and round.</p>

<epigraph>
<p>Red light. Bell.</p>

<p>A block deep <num type="cardinal" value="4">four</num> ranks of cars wait at the grade crossing, fenders in taillights, mudguards scraping mudguards, motors purring hot, exhausts reeking, cars from Babylon and Jamaica, cars from Montauk, Port Jefferson, Patchogue, limousines from Long Beach, Far Rockaway, roadsters from Great Neck . . . cars full of asters and wet bathingsuits, sunsinged necks, mouths sticky from sodas and hotdawgs . . . cars dusted with pollen of ragweed and goldenrod.</p>

<p>Green light. Motors race, gears screech into first. The cars space out, flow in a long ribbon along the ghostly cement road, between blackwindowed blocks of concrete factories, between bright slabbed colors of signboards towards the glow over the city that stands up incredibly into the night sky like the glow of a great lit tent, like the yellow tall bulk of a tentshow.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Then we'll have a regular old fashioned Long Island shore dinner.

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"And do have him take these wretched roses away <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName>. . . . I hate faded flowers."</said></p>

<p>Steam from the plated bowl of clams uncoiled in the rosy glow from the lampshade. <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>watched her fingers, pink and limber, pulling the clams by their long necks out of their shells, dipping them in melted butter, and popping them dripping in her mouth.

Think of it I was crazy in love with her and now I <orig>cant</orig> remember what her <num type="ordinal" value="1">first</num> name was . . . Funny isn't it? Things had been extremely slow ever since I had set up in practice for myself. It was a rash thing to do, as I was only <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> years out of lawschool and had no money to run on. I was rash in those days. I'd decided that if I didn't get a case that day I'd chuck everything and go back to a clerkship. I went out for a walk to clear my head and saw a freightcar shunting down <address><num type="ordinal" value="11">Eleventh</num> Avenue</address> run into a milkwagon. It was a horrid mess and when we'd picked the fellow up I said to myself I'd get him his rightful damages or bankrupt myself in the attempt.

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"So he drove a milkwagon did he? I think <occupation>milkmen</occupation> are the nicest people in the world. Mine's the cutest thing."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"She was like a wild rose <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Elaine</addName></persName>, fresh and pink and full of the <nationality>Irish</nationality>, and now she's a rather stumpy businesslike looking little woman."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But it isn't any fun any more. All I do is sit in the office and let the young fellows do the work. My future's all cut out for me.

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why <orig>dont</orig> you go into politics?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why should I go up to Washington into that greasy backwater when I'm right on the spot where they give the orders?

<p>At the bar under a picture of the Lusitania stood a dark man in a white coat distended by a deep gorilla chest. He was vibrating a shaker between his very hairy hands.

<p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> was looking at the face wrinkled like a walnut and the dead codfish eyes of the <occupation>waiter</occupation>pouring coffee. <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>was leaning back in his chair staring at her through his eyelashes.

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why have you kept me dangling then? I'm not the sort of man you can play like a trout. You know that perfectly well."</said></p>

<p>She looked straight at him with wide gray eyes; the light gave a sheen of gold to the little brown specks in the iris.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's not so easy never to be able to have friends."</said> She looked down at her fingers on the edge of the table. His eyes were on the glint of copper along her eyelashes. Suddenly he snapped the silence that was tightening between them.</p>

<p>hummed <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName> <forename>Jake</forename></persName> as the big shining shaker quivered between his hairy hands.

He was crumbling plaster with something that rattled achingly in his chest, she was an intricate machine of sawtooth steel whitebright bluebright copperbright in his arms. When they stopped her breast and the side of her body and her thigh came against him. He was suddenly full of blood steaming with sweat like a runaway horse. A breeze through an open door hustled the tobaccosmoke and the clotted pink air of the restaurant.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName>  I want to go down to see the murder cottage; please take me."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"As if I hadn't seen enough of X's marking the spot where the crime was committed."</said></p>


<p>In the hall <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> stepped in front of them. He was pale as chalk, his black tie was crooked, the nostrils of his thin nose were dilated and marked with little veins of red.</p>

<p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName>."</said></p>

<p>His voice croaked tartly like a klaxon. <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Elaine</addName></persName> I've been looking for you. I must speak to you. . . . Maybe you think I'm joking. I never joke."</said></p>

<p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName> excuse me <time dur-iso="PT1M">a minute</time>. . . . Now what is the matter <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName>? Come back to the table."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName> I was not joking either. . . . <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName> do you mind ordering me a taxi?"</said></p>

<p><persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> grabbed hold of her wrist. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You've been playing with me long enough, do you hear me? Some day some man's going to take a gun and shoot you. You think you can play me like all the other little sniveling fools. . . . You're no better than a common <occupation>prostitute</occupation>."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName> I told you to go get me a taxi."</said></p>

<p><persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> bit his lip and went out the front door.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Elaine</addName></persName> what are you going to do?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName> I will not be bullied."</said></p>

<p>Something nickel flashed in <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>'s hand. <persName ref="#GusMcNiel"><forename>Gus</forename> <surname>McNiel</surname></persName> stepped forward and gripped his wrist with a big red hand.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gimme that <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName>. . . . For God's sake man pull yourself together."</said> He shoved the revolver into his pocket. <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>tottered to the wall in front of him. The trigger finger of his right hand was bleeding.</p>

<p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Here's a taxi,"</said> said <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName> looking from<num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num>to another of the taut white faces.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right you take the girl home. . . . No harm done, just a little nervous attack, see? No cause for alarm,"</said> <persName ref="#GusMcNiel"><surname>McNiel</surname></persName> was shouting in the voice of a man speaking from a soapbox. The <occupation>headwaiter</occupation> and the <occupation>coatgirl</occupation> were looking at each other uneasily. <said who="#GusMcNiel" aloud="true" direct="true">"Didn't nutten happen. . . . Gentleman's a little nervous . . . overwork you understand,"</said> <persName ref="#GusMcNiel"><surname>McNiel</surname></persName> brought his voice down to a reassuring purr. <said who="#GusMcNiel" aloud="true" direct="true">"You just forget it."</said></p>



<p>As they were getting into the taxi <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> suddenly said in a little child's voice: <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I forgot we were going down to see the murder cottage. . . . Let's make him wait. I'd like to walk up and down in the air for <time dur-iso="PT1M">a minute</time>."</said> There was a smell of saltmarshes. The night was marbled with clouds and moonlight. The toads in the ditches sounded like sleighbells.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Is it far?"</said> she asked.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"No it's right down at the corner."</said></p>

<p>Their feet crackled on gravel then ground softly on macadam. A headlight blinded them, they stopped to let the car whir by; the exhaust filled their nostrils, faded into the smell of saltmarshes again.</p>

<p>It was a peaked gray house with a small porch facing the road screened with broken lattice. A big locust shaded it from behind. A <occupation>policeman</occupation> walked to and fro in front of it whistling gently to himself. A mildewed scrap of moon came out from behind the clouds for <time dur-iso="PT1M">a minute</time>, made tinfoil of a bit of broken glass in a gaping window, picked out the little rounded leaves of the locust and rolled like a lost dime into a crack in the clouds.</p>

<p>Neither of them said anything. They walked back towards the roadhouse.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Honestly <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName> <orig>havent</orig> you seen <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName>?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"No I <orig>havent</orig> an idea where he could be hiding himself."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"If you see him tell him I want him to call me up at once. . . . <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName>  what were those women called who followed the <orgname>armies</orgname> in the <event><nationality>French</nationality> Revolution</event>?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Let's think. Was it <foreign xml:lang="fr">cantonnières?</foreign>"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Something like that . . . I'd like to do that."</said></p>

<p>An electric train whistled far to the right of them, rattled nearer and faded into whining distance.</p>

<p>Dripping with a tango the roadhouse melted pink like a block of icecream. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> was following her into the taxicab.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"No I want to be alone, <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName>."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But I'd like very much to take you home. . . . I <orig>dont</orig> like the idea of letting you go all alone."</said></p>



<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Please as a friend I ask you."</said></p>

<p>They <orig>didnt</orig> shake hands. The taxi kicked dust and a rasp of burnt gasoline in his face. He stood on the steps reluctant to go back into the noise and fume.</p>

<p><persName ref="#NellieMcNiel"><forename>Nellie</forename> <surname>McNiel</surname></persName> was alone at the table. In front of her was the chair pushed back with his napkin on the back of it where her husband had sat. She was staring straight ahead of her; the <occupation>dancers</occupation> passed like shadows across her eyes. At the other end of the room she saw <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>, pale and lean, walk slowly like a sick man to his table. He stood beside the table examining his check carefully, paid it and stood looking distractedly round the room. He was going to look at her. The <occupation>waiter</occupation> brought the change on a plate and bowed low. <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> swept the faces of the <occupation>dancers</occupation> with a black glance, turned his back square and walked out. Remembering the insupportable sweetness of <nationality>Chinese</nationality> lilies, she felt her eyes filling with tears. She took her engagement book out of her silver mesh bag and went through it hurriedly, marking carets with a silver pencil. She looked up after a little while, the tired skin of her face in a pucker of spite, and beckoned to a <occupation>waiter</occupation>. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Will you please tell <persName ref="#GusMcNiel"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>McNiel</surname></persName> that <persName ref="#NellieMcNiel"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>McNiel</surname></persName> wants to speak to him?

<p><persName ref="#GrantBullock"><surname>Bullock</surname></persName> winked <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> eye and waved a drunken hand. The voices in <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName>'s ears were throbbing elastic roar, near, far, near, far. Dies like a dog, march on he said. He'd spent all his money but a quarter. Shot at sunrise. Declaration of war. Commencement of hostilities. And they left him alone in his glory. Leipzig, the Wilderness, Waterloo, where the embattled farmers stood and fired the shot heard round . . . <orig>Cant</orig> take a taxi, want to walk anyway. Ultimatum. Trooptrains singing to the shambles with flowers on their ears. And shame on the false Etruscan who lingers in his home when . . .</p>

<p>As he was walking down the gravel drive to the road an arm hooked in his.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Do you mind if I come along? I <orig>dont</orig> want to stay here."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sure come ahead <persName ref="#TonyHunter"><forename>Tony</forename></persName> I'm going to walk."</said></p>

<p><persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName>  walked with a long stride, looking straight ahead of him. Clouds had darkened the sky where remained the faintest milkiness of moonlight. To the right and left there was outside of the violetgray cones of occasional arclights black pricked by few lights, ahead the glare of streets rose in blurred cliffs yellow and ruddy.</p>

<p><said who="#TonyHunter" aloud="true" direct="true">"You <orig>dont</orig> like me do you?"</said> said <persName ref="#TonyHunter"><forename>Tony</forename> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName> breathlessly after a few minutes.</p>

<p><persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName> slowed his pace. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why I <orig>dont</orig> know you very well. You seem to me a very pleasant person. . . ."</said></p>



<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Dont</orig> lie; there's no reason why you should. . . . I think I'm going to kill myself tonight."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You have no right to tell me not to kill myself. You <orig>dont</orig> know anything about me. If I was a woman you <orig> wouldnt</orig>  be so indifferent."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What's eating you anyway?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm going crazy that's all, everything's so horrible.

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I guess it's the Times. . . . I'll get fired soon, don't worry."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm tired of being poor; I want to make a hit."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well you're young yet; you must be younger than I am."</said> <persName ref="#TonyHunter"><forename>Tony</forename></persName> <orig>didnt</orig> answer.</p>

<p>They were walking down a broad avenue between<num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num>rows of blackened frame houses. A streetcar long and yellow hissed rasping past.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why we must be in Flatbush."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName>  I used to think you were like me, but now I never see you except with some woman."</said></p>

As they passed under an arclight, <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> caught the glisten of the tears on his cheeks. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I wouldn't tell you this if I <orig>wasnt</orig> drunk."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But things like that happened to almost everybody when they were kids. . . . You oughtnt to worry about that."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But I'm that way now, that's what's so horrible. I <orig>cant</orig> like women. I've tried and tried. . . . You see I was caught. I was so ashamed I wouldn't go to school for weeks. My mother cried and cried. I'm so ashamed. I'm so afraid people will find out about it. I'm always fighting to keep it hidden, to hide my feelings."</said></p>



<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But it all may be an idea. You may be able to get over it. Go to a psychoanalyist."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I <orig>cant</orig> talk to anybody. It's just that tonight I'm drunk. I've tried to look it up in the encyclopedia. . . . It's not even in the dictionary."</said> He stopped and leaned against a lamppost with his face in his hands. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's not even in the dictionary."</said></p>

<p><persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename> <surname>Herf</surname></persName> patted him on the back. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Buck up for Heaven's sake. They're lots of people in the same boat. The stage is full of them."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I hate them all. . . . It's not people like that I fall in love with. I hate myself. I suppose you'll hate me after tonight."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What nonsense. It's no business of mine."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Now you know why I want to kill myself. . . . Oh it's not fair <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName>, it's not fair. . . . I've had no luck in my life. I started earning my living as soon as I got out of highschool. I used to be bellhop in summer hotels. My mother lived in Lakewood and I used to send her everything I earned. I've worked so hard to get where I am. If it were known, if there were a scandal and it all came out I'd be ruined."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But everybody says that of all juveniles and nobody lets it worry them."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Whenever I fail to get a part I think it's on account of that. I hate and despise all that kind of men. . . . I <orig>dont</orig> want to be a juvenile. I want to act. Oh it's hell. . . . It's hell."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But you're rehearsing now aren't you?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"A fool show that'll never get beyond Stamford. Now when you hear that I've done it you <orig>wont</orig> be surprised."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Done what?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Killed myself."</said></p>

<p>They walked without speaking. It had started to rain. Down the street behind the low greenblack shoebox houses there was an occasional mothpink flutter of lightning. A wet dusty smell came up from the asphalt beaten by the big plunking drops.</p>



<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"There ought to be a subway station near. . . . Isn't that a blue light down there? Let's hurry or we'll get soaked."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh <distinct type="taboo">hell</distinct><persName ref="#TonyHunter"><forename>Tony</forename></persName> I'd just as soon get soaked as not."</said> <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> took off his felt hat and swung it in <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> hand. The raindrops were cool on his forehead, the smell of the rain, of roofs and mud and asphalt, took the biting taste of whiskey and cigarettes out of his mouth.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gosh it's horrible,"</said> he shouted suddenly.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All the hushdope about sex. I'd never realized it before tonight, the full extent of the agony. God you must have a rotten time. . . . We all of us have a rotten time. In your case it's just luck, hellish bad luck. Martin used to say: Everything would be so much better if suddenly a bell rang and everybody told everybody else honestly what they did about it, how they lived, how they loved. It's hiding things makes them putrefy. By God it's horrible. As if life wasn't difficult enough without that."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I'm going down into this subway station."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You'll have to wait hours for a train."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I <orig>cant</orig> help it I'm tired and I <orig>dont</orig> want to get wet."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well good night."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Good night <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName>."</said></p>

<p>There was a long rolling thunderclap. It began to rain hard. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename><surname>Herf</surname></persName> rammed his hat down on his head and yanked his coatcollar up. He wanted to run along yelling <distinct type="swearing">sonsobitches</distinct> at the top of his lungs. Lightning flickered along the staring rows of dead windows. The rain seethed along the pavements, against storewindows, on brownstone steps. His knees were wet, a slow trickle started down his back, there were chilly cascades off his sleeves onto his wrists, his whole body itched and tingled. He walked on through <placeName><district>Brooklyn</district></placeName>. Obsession of all the beds in all the pigeonhole bedrooms, tangled sleepers twisted and strangled like the roots of potbound plants. Obsession of feet creaking on the stairs of lodginghouses, hands fumbling at doorknobs. Obsession of pounding temples and solitary bodies rigid on their beds.

<p>They pair off hurriedly. Standing Up in Cars Strictly Forbidden. The climbing chain grates, grips the cogs; jerkily the car climbs the incline out of the whirring lights, out of the smell of crowds and steamed corn and peanuts, up jerkily grating up through the tall night of <date when="--09--">September</date> meteors.</p>

<p>Sea, marshsmell, the lights of an Iron Steamboat leaving the dock. Across wide violet indigo a lighthouse blinks. Then the swoop. The sea does a flipflop, the lights soar. Her hair in his mouth, his hand in her ribs, thighs grind together.</p>

<p>The wind of their falling has snatched their yells, they jerk rattling upwards through the tangled girderstructure. Swoop. Soar. Bubbling lights in a sandwich of darkness and sea. Swoop. Keep Your Seats for the Next Ride.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Naw stick around awhile, we'll open a bottle of glue."</said></p>

<p>They heard a heavy stumbling in the passage outside the kitchen.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Whossat?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Zat you <persName ref="#JoeHarland"><forename>Joe</forename></persName>?"</said> A big towheaded boy with lumpy shoulders and a square red face and thickset neck lurched into the room.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What the <distinct type="taboo">hell</distinct> do you think this is? . . . This is my kid brother <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><forename>Mike</forename></persName>."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well what about it?"</said> <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><forename>Mike</forename></persName> stood swaying with his chin on his chest. His shoulders bulged against the low ceiling of the kitchen.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<distinct type="informal"><orig>Aint</orig></distinct> he a whale?

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'd like to see you put me outa here, git me? I'd like to see you put me outa here."</said></p>

<p><persName ref="#JoeHarland"><forename>Harland</forename></persName> got to his feet. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I'm going," he said. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Got to see if I can get that job."</said></p>

<p><persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><forename>Mike</forename></persName> was advancing across the kitchen with his fists clenched. Joey's jaw set; he picked up a chair.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'll crown you with it."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"O saints and martyrs <orig>cant</orig> a woman have no peace in her own house?"</said> A small grayhaired woman ran screaming between them; she had lustrous black eyes set far apart in a face shrunken like a last year's apple; she beat the air with worktwisted hands. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Shut yer traps both of ye, always cursing an fightin round the house like there warnt no God. . . . <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><forename>Mike</forename></persName> you go upstairs an lay down on your bed till yer sober."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I was jus tellin him that,"</said> said Joey.</p>

<p>She turned on <persName ref="#JoeHarland"><forename>Harland</forename></persName>, her voice like the screech of chalk on a blackboard. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>An</orig> you git along outa here.

<p><persName ref="#JoeHarland"><forename>Harland</forename></persName> looked at Joey with a little sour smile, shrugged his shoulders and went out. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Charwoman,"</said> he muttered as he stumbled with stiff aching legs along the dusty street of darkfaced brick houses.</p>

<p>The sultry afternoon sun was like a blow on his back. Voices in his ears of maids, charwomen, cooks, stenographers, secretaries: Yes sir, <persName ref="#JoeHarland"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Harland</surname></persName>, Thank you sir <persName ref="#JoeHarland"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Harland</surname></persName>. Oh sir thank you sir so much sir <persName ref="#JoeHarland"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Harland</surname></persName> sir. . . .</p>

<p>Red buzzing in her eyelids the sunlight wakes her, she sinks back into purpling cottonwool corridors of sleep, wakes again, turns over yawning, pulls her knees up to her chin to pull the drowsysweet cocoon tighter about her. A truck jangles shatteringly along the street, the sun lays hot stripes on her back. She yawns desperately and twists herself over and lies wide awake with her hands under her head staring at the ceiling. From far away through streets and housewalls the long moan of a steamboat whistle penetrates to her like a blunt sprout of crabgrass nudging through gravel. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> sits up shaking her head to get rid of a fly blundering about her face. The fly flashes and vanishes in the sunlight, but somewhere in her there lingers a droning pang, unaccountable, something left over from last night's bitter thoughts. But she is happy and wide awake and it's early. She gets up and wanders round the room in her nightgown.</p>

<p>Where the sun hits it the hardwood floor is warm to the soles of her feet. Sparrows chirp on the windowledge. From upstairs comes the sound of a sewingmachine. When she gets out of the bath her body feels smoothwhittled and tense; she rubs herself with a towel, telling off the hours of the long day ahead; take a walk through junky littered downtown streets to that pier on the <geogName>East <geogFeat>River</geogFeat></geogName> where they pile the great beams of mahogany, breakfast all alone at the Lafayette, coffee and crescent rolls and sweet butter, go shopping at Lord & Taylor's early before everything is stuffy and the salesgirls wilted, have lunch with . . . Then the pain that has been teasing all night wells up and bursts. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName>, <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName> for God's sake,"</said> she says aloud. She sits before her mirror staring in the black of her own dilating pupils.</p>

<p>She dresses in a hurry and goes out, walks down <address><num type="ordinal" value="5">Fifth</num> Avenue</address> and east along <address><num type="ordinal" value="8">Eighth</num> Street</address> without looking to the right or left. The sun already hot simmers slatily on the pavements, on plateglass, on dustmarbled enameled signs. Men's and women's faces as they pass her are rumpled and gray like pillows that have been too much slept on. After crossing <address>Lafayette Street</address> roaring with trucks and delivery wagons there is a taste of dust in her mouth, particles of grit crunch between her teeth. Further east she passes pushcarts; men are wiping off the marble counters of softdrink stands, a grindorgan fills the street with shiny jostling coils of the Blue Danube, acrid pungence spreads from a picklestand. In <address>Tompkins Square</address> yelling children mill about the soggy asphalt. At her feet a squirming heap of small boys, dirty torn shirts, slobbering mouths, punching, biting, scratching; a squalid smell like moldy bread comes from them. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> all of a sudden feels her knees weak under her. She turns and walks back the way she came.</p>

<p>The sun is heavy like his arm across her back, strokes her bare forearm the way his fingers stroke her, it's his breath against her cheek.</p>

<p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Nothing but the <num type="cardinal" value="5">five</num> statutory questions,"</said> said <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> to the rawboned man with big sagging eyes like oysters into whose long shirtfront she was talking.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"And so the decree is granted?"</said> he asked solemnly.</p>

<p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Surely in an uncontested . . ."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You mean there is somebody else?"</said></p>

<p>She looked up at him with bright eyes and half nodded.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh but divorce is a very serious step my dear young lady."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh not so serious as all that."</said></p>

<p>They saw <persName ref="#HarryGoldweiser"><forename>Harry</forename> <surname>Goldweiser</surname></persName> coming towards them across the big walnut paneled room. She suddenly raised her voice. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"They say that this battle of the Marne is going to end the war."</said></p>

<p><persName ref="#HarryGoldweiser"><forename>Harry</forename> <surname>Goldweiser</surname></persName> took her hand between his <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> pudgy-palmed hands and bowed over it. <said who="#HarryGoldweiser" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's very charming of you <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Elaine</addName></persName> to come and keep a lot of old midsummer bachelors from boring each other to death.

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Yes how is it we have the pleasure of still finding you here?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh various things have held me. . . .

<p><persName ref="#DickSnow"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Snow</surname></persName> let out a gruff sniff. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Seems to me I've heard you been going into the realestate game down there, <persName ref="#HarryGoldweiser"><surname>Goldweiser</surname></persName>,"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I bought myself a cottage that's all. It's amazing you <orig>cant</orig> even buy yourself a cottage without every newsboy on <address>Times Square</address> knowing about it. Let's go in and eat; my sister'll be right here."</said> A dumpy woman in a spangled dress came in after they had sat down to table in the big antlerhung diningroom; she was pigeonbreasted and had a sallow skin.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><roleName type="honorific">Miss</roleName> <surname type="married">Oglethorpe</surname></persName> I'm so glad to see you,"</said> she twittered in a little voice like a parrakeet's. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I've often seen you and thought you were the loveliest thing. . . .

<p>The long day love was crisp in the curls . . . the dark curls . . . broken in the dark steel light . . . hurls . . . high O God high into the bright . . . She was cutting with her fork in the crisp white heart of a lettuce. She was saying words while quite other words spilled confusedly inside her like a broken package of beads. She sat looking at a picture of<num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num>women and<num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num>men eating at a table in a high paneled room under a shivering crystal chandelier. She looked up from her plate to find <persName ref="#RachelGoldweiser"><roleName type="honorific">Miss</roleName> <surname>Goldweiser</surname></persName>'s little birdeyes kindly querulous fixed hard on her face.</p>

<p><said who="#RachelGoldweiser" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh yes <placeName><settlement type="city">New York</settlement></placeName> is really pleasanter in midsummer than any other time; there's less hurry and bustle."</said></p>

All the long day love Was crisp in the curls of his high thin brow, Flashed in his eyes in dark steel light. . . .</p>

<p>In the taxi <persName ref="#HarryGoldweiser"><surname>Goldweiser</surname></persName>'s broad short knees pressed against hers; his eyes were full of furtive spiderlike industry weaving a warm sweet choking net about her face and neck. <persName ref="#RachelGoldweiser"><roleName type="honorific">Miss</roleName> <surname>Goldweiser</surname></persName> had relapsed pudgily into the seat beside her. <persName ref="#DickSnow"><forename>Dick</forename> <surname>Snow</surname></persName> was holding an unlighted cigar in his mouth, rolling it with his tongue. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> tried to remember exactly how <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName> looked, his polevaulter's tight slenderness; she couldn't remember his face entire, she saw his eyes, lips, an ear.</p>

<p><address>Times Square</address> was full of juggled colored lights, criss-crossed corrugations of glare. They went up in the elevator at the Astor. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> followed <persName ref="#RachelGoldweiser"><roleName type="honorific">Miss</roleName> <surname>Goldweiser</surname></persName> across the roofgarden among the tables. Men and women in evening dress, in summer muslins and light suits turned and looked after her, like sticky tendrils of vines glances caught at her as she passed. The orchestra was playing In My Harem. They arranged themselves at a table.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Shall we dance?"</said> asked <persName ref="#HarryGoldweiser"><surname>Goldweiser</surname></persName>.</p>

<p>She smiled a wry broken smile in his face as she let him put his arm round her back. His big ear with solemn lonely hairs on it was on the level of her eyes.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Elaine</addName></persName>,"</said> he was breathing into her ear, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"honest I thought I was a wise guy."</said> He caught his breath . . . <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"but I aint. . . .

<p>Suddenly she remembered <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName>'s face altogether, he was standing in front of her with a bow tie crooked in his soft shirt, his hair rumpled, drinking again.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> I'm so glad to see you. . . ."</said></p>

<p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> <orig>couldnt</orig> see his face. The orchestra, the jangle of voices, the clatter of plates spouted spiraling louder and louder about her . . .</p>

<p>And the ladies of the harem</p>

<p>Knew exactly how to wear 'em</p>

<p>In O-riental <placeName><settlement type="city">Bagdad</settlement></placeName> long ago. . . .</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Thanks . . . thanks."</said></p>

<p>She started to dance again with <persName ref="#HarryGoldweiser"><forename>Harry</forename> <surname>Goldweiser</surname></persName>. The roofgarden was spinning fast, then less fast. The noise ebbed sickeningly. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Excuse me <time dur-iso="PT1M">a minute</time> <persName ref="#HarryGoldweiser"><forename>Harry</forename></persName>,"</said> she said.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'll come back to the table."</said> In the ladies' room she let herself down carefully on the plush sofa. She looked at her face in the round mirror of her vanity case. From black pinholes her pupils spread blurring till everything was black.</p>

<p><persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename> <surname>Herf</surname></persName>'s legs were tired; he had been walking all afternoon. He sat down on a bench beside the Aquarium and looked out over the water. The fresh <date when="--09--">September</date> wind gave a glint of steel to the little crisp waves of the harbor and to the slateblue smutted sky. A big white steamer with a yellow funnel was passing in front of the statue of Liberty. The smoke from the tug at the bow came out sharply scalloped like paper. In spite of the encumbering wharfhouses the end of <placeName><district>Manhattan</district></placeName> seemed to him like the prow of a barge pushing slowly and evenly down the harbor. Gulls wheeled and cried. He got to his feet with a jerk. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh <distinct type="taboo">hell</distinct>I've got to do something."</said></p>

<p>He stood <time dur-iso="PT1S">a second</time> with tense muscles balanced on the balls of his feet.

<p>Across the zinc water the tall walls, the birchlike cluster of downtown buildings shimmered up the rosy morning like a sound of horns through a chocolatebrown haze. As the boat drew near the buildings densened to a granite mountain split with knifecut canyons. The ferry passed close to a tubby steamer that rode at anchor listing towards <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName> so that he could see all the decks. An Ellis Island tug was alongside. A stale smell came from the decks packed with upturned faces like a load of melons.  <num type="cardinal" value="3">Three</num> gulls wheeled complaining. A gull soared in a spiral, white wings caught the sun, the gull skimmed motionless in whitegold light. The rim of the sun had risen above the plumcolored band of clouds behind East <placeName><settlement type="city">New York</settlement></placeName>. <num type="cardinal" value="1000000">A million</num> windows flashed with light. A rasp and a humming came from the city.</p>

<p>One more <geogFeat>river</geogFeat> to cross</p>


<p>In the whitening light tinfoil gulls wheeled above broken boxes, spoiled cabbageheads, orangerinds heaving slowly between the splintered plank walls, the green spumed under the round bow as the ferry skidding on the tide, gulped the broken water, crashed, slid, settled slowly into the slip. Handwinches whirled with jingle of chains, gates folded upward. <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName> stepped across the crack, staggered up the manuresmelling wooden tunnel of the ferryhouse out into the sunny glass and benches of the Battery. He sat down on a bench, clasped his hands round his knees to keep them from shaking so. His mind went on jingling like a mechanical piano.</p>

<p>With bells on her fingers and rings on her toes</p>

<p>Shall ride a white lady upon a great horse</p>

<p>And she shall make mischief wherever she goes . . .</p>



<p>There was <placeName><settlement type="city">Babylon</settlement></placeName> and <placeName><settlement type="city">Nineveh</settlement></placeName>, they were built of brick. <placeName><settlement type="city">Athens</settlement></placeName> was goldmarble columns. <placeName><settlement type="city">Rome</settlement></placeName>was held up on broad arches of rubble.

O there's <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> more <geogFeat>river</geogFeat> to cross. Steel glass, tile, concrete will be the materials of the skyscrapers. Crammed on the narrow island the <num type="cardinal" value="1000000">million</num> windowed buildings will jut, glittering pyramid on pyramid, white cloudsheads piled above a thunderstorm . . .</p>

<p>And it rained forty days and it rained forty nights</p>

<p>And it didn't stop till <date when="--12-25">Christmas</date></p>

<p>And the only man who survived the flood</p>

<p>Was longlegged Jack of the Isthmus. . . .</p>


<p>Kerist I wish I was a skyscraper.</p>

<p>The lock spun round in a circle to keep out the key. Dexterously <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName> bided his time and caught it. He shot headlong through the open door and down the long hall shouting <persName ref="#PearlineAnderson"><forename>Pearline</forename></persName> into the livingroom. It smelled funny, <persName ref="#PearlineAnderson"><forename>Pearline</forename></persName>'s smell, to <distinct type="taboo">hell</distinct> with it. He picked up a chair; the chair wanted to fly, it swung round his head and crashed into the window, the glass shivered and tinkled. He looked out through the window. The street stood up on end. A hookandladder and a fire engine were climbing it licketysplit trailing a droning sirenshriek. Fire fire, pour on water, <placeName><country>Scotland</country></placeName>'s burning. <measure type="currency"><num type="cardinal" value="1000">A thousand</num> dollar</measure> fire, <measure type="currency"><num type="cardinal" value="100000">a hundredthousand</num> dollar</measure> fire, <measure type="currency"><num type="cardinal" value="1000000">a million</num> dollar</measure> fire. Skyscrapers go up like flames, in flames, flames. He spun back into the room. The table turned a somersault. The chinacloset jumped on the table. Oak chairs climbed on top to the gas jet. Pour on water, <placeName><country>Scotland</country></placeName>'s burning. Don't like the smell in this place in the <placeName><settlement type="city">City of New York</settlement></placeName>, County of New York, State of New York. He lay on his back on the floor of the revolving kitchen and laughed and laughed. The only man who survived the flood rode a great lady on a white horse. Up in flames, up, up. Kerosene whispered a greasy faced can in the corner of the kitchen. Pour on water. He stood swaying on the crackling upside down chairs on the upside down table. The kerosene licked him with a white cold tongue. He pitched, grabbed the gas jet, the gas jet gave way, he lay in a puddle on his back striking matches, wet wouldn't light. A match spluttered, lit; he held the flame carefully between his hands.</p>

<p><said who="#PearlineAnderson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh yes but my husband's awfully ambitious."</said> <persName ref="#PearlineAnderson"><forename>Pearline</forename></persName> was telling the blue gingham lady in the grocery-store. <said who="#PearlineAnderson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Likes to have a good time an all that but he's much more ambitious than anybody I every knew.

The sun was still warm although there was a tang of fall in the wind. She gave <measure type="currency">a penny</measure> to a blind man cranking the <title>Merry Widow waltz</title> out of a grindorgan. Still she'd better bawl him out a little when he came home, might get to doing it often. She turned into <address><num type="ordinal" value="200">200th</num> Street</address>. People were looking out of windows, there was a crowd gathering. It was a fire. She sniffed the singed air. It gave her gooseflesh; she loved seeing fires. She hurried. Why it's outside our building. Outside our apartmenthouse. Smoke dense as gunnysacks rolled out of the fifthstory window. She suddenly found herself all atremble. The colored <occupation>elevatorboy</occupation> ran up to her. His face was green. <said who="#PearlineAnderson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh it's in our apartment"</said> she shrieked, <said who="#PearlineAnderson" aloud="true" direct="true">"and the furniture just came a week ago.

A <occupation>policeman</occupation> stood in her way, she threw herself at him and pounded on the broad blue chest. She <orig>couldnt</orig>  stop shrieking. <said aloud="true" direct="true">"That's all right little lady, that's all right,"</said> he kept booming in a deep voice. As she beat her head against it she could feel his voice rumbling in his chest. <said aloud="true" direct="true">"They're bringing him down, just overcome by smoke that's all, just overcome by smoke."</said></p>

<p><said who="#PearlineAnderson" aloud="true" direct="true">"O <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><forename>Stanwood</forename></persName> my husband,"</said> she shrieked. Everything was blacking out. She grabbed at <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> bright buttons on the <occupation>policeman</occupation>'s coat and fainted.</p>

    <p>It is beginning to snow. The flakes are giltedged where they pass the streetlamp. Through the plate glass the <placeName>Cosmopolitan Cafe</placeName> full of blue and green opal rifts of smoke looks like a muddy aquarium: faces blob whitely round the tables like illassorted fishes. Umbrellas begin to bob in clusters up the snowmottled street. The orator turns up his collar and walks briskly east along Houston, holding the muddy soapbox away from his trousers.</p>

    <p>Faces, hats, hands, newspapers jiggled in the fetid roaring subway car like corn in a popper. The downtown express passed clattering in yellow light, window telescoping window till they overlapped like scales.</p>

    <p>They walked along in silence.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#PhilSandbourne"><surname>Sandbourne</surname></persName> walked with his hat in his hand. His hair was almost white but his eyebrows were still dark and bushy. Every few steps he changed the length of his stride as if it hurt him to walk. He cleared his throat. <said who="#PhilSandbourne" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName> you were asking me if I'd cooked up any schemes when I was in hospital. . . . Do you remember years ago old man <persName ref="#Specker"><addName type="nickname">Specker</addName></persName> used to talk about vitreous and superenameled tile? Well I've been workin on his formula out at Hollis. . . . A friend of mine there has a <num type="cardinal" value="2000">two thousand</num> degree oven he bakes pottery in. I think it can be put on a commercial basis. . . . Man it would revolutionize the whole industry. Combined with concrete it would enormously increase the flexibility of the materials at the <occupation>architects</occupation>' disposal. We could make tile any color, size or finish. . . . Imagine this city when all the buildins instead of bein dirty gray were ornamented with vivid colors. Imagine bands of scarlet round the entablatures of skyscrapers. Colored tile would revolutionize the whole life of the city. . . . Instead of fallin back on the orders or on gothic or romanesque decorations we could evolve new designs, new colors, new forms. If there was a little color in the town all this hards<distinct type="taboo">hell</distinct>inhibited life'd break down. . . . There'd be more love an less divorce. . . ."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> burst out laughing. <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"You tell em <persName ref="#PhilSandbourne"><forename>Phil</forename></persName>. . . . I'll talk to you about that sometime. You must come up to dinner when <persName ref="#CecilyBaldwin"><forename>Cecily</forname></persName>'s there and tell us about it. . . . Why <orig>wont</orig> Parkhurst do anything?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#PhilSandbourne" aloud="true" direct="true">"I <orig> wouldnt</orig> let him in on it. He'd cotton on to the proposition and leave me out in the cold once he had the formula. I wouldn't trust him with a rubber nickel."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why doesnt he take you into partnership <persName ref="#PhilSandbourne"><forename>Phil</forename></persName>?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#PhilSandbourne" aloud="true" direct="true">"He's got me where he wants me anyway. . . . He knows I do all the work in his <distinct type="taboo">goddamned</distinct> office. He knows too that I'm too cranky to make out with most people. He's a slick article."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"Still I should think you could put it up to him."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#PhilSandbourne" aloud="true" direct="true">"He's got me where he wants me and he knows it, so I continue doin the work while he amasses the coin. . . . I guess it's logical. If I had more money I'd just spend it. I'm just shiftless."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"But look here man you're not so much older than I am. . . . You've still got a career ahead of you."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>stopped at a corner and slapped his hand on the briefcase he was carrying. <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"Now <persName ref="#PhilSandbourne"><forename>Phil</forename></persName> you know I'd be very glad to give you a hand in any way I could. . . . But just at the moment my financial situation is terribly involved. I've gotten into some rather rash entanglements and Heaven knows how I'm going to get out of them. . . . That's why I <orig>cant</orig> have a scandal or a divorce or anything. You <orig>dont</orig> understand how complicatedly things interact. . . . I <orig>couldnt</orig>  take up anything new, not for a year at least. This war in <placeName><bloc type="continent">Europe</block></placeName> has made things very unsettled downtown. Anything's liable to happen."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#PhilSandbourne" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right. Good night <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName>."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#PhilSandbourne"><surname>Sandbourne</surname></persName> turned abruptly on his heel and walked down the avenue again. He was tired and his legs ached. It was almost dark. On the way back to the station the grimy brick and brownstone blocks dragged past monotonously like the days of his life.</p>



    <p>Under the skin of her temples iron clamps tighten till her head will mash like an egg; she begins to walk with long strides up and down the room that bristles with itching stuffiness; spotty colors of pictures, carpets, chairs wrap about her like a choking hot blanket. Outside the window the backyards are striped with blue and lilac and topaz of a rainy twilight. She opens the window. <said who="#StanwoodEmery" aloud="true" direct="true">No time to get tight like the twilight,</said> <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName> said. The telephone reached out shivering beady tentacles of sound. She slams the window down. O <distinct type="taboo">hell</distinct> <orig>cant</orig> they give you any peace?</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why <persName ref="#HarryGoldweiser"><forename>Harry</forename></persName> I <orig>didnt</orig> know you were back. . . . Oh I wonder if I can. . . . Oh yes I guess I can. Come along by after the theater. . . . <orig>Isnt</orig> that wonderful? You must tell me all about it."</said> She no sooner puts the receiver down than the bell clutches at her again. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello. . . . No I dont. . . . Oh yes maybe I do. . . . When did you get back?"</said> She laughed a tinkling telephone laugh. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"But <persName ref="#HarryGoldweiser"><forename type="birth">Howard</forename></persName> I'm terribly busy. . . . Yes I am honestly. . . . Have you been to the show? Well sometime come round after a performance. . . . I'm so anxious to hear about your trip . . . you know . . . Goodby <persName ref="#HarryGoldweiser"><forename type="birth">Howard</forename></persName>."</said></p>

    <p>A walk'll make me feel better. She sits at her dressingtable and shakes her hair down about her shoulders. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's such a hellish nuisance, I'd like to cut it all off . . . spreads apace. The shadow of white Death. . . . Oughtnt to stay up so late, those dark circles under my eyes. . . . And at the door, Invisible Corruption. . . . If I could only cry; there are people who can cry their eyes out, really cry themselves blind . . . Anyway the divorce'll go through. . . .</p>

    <p>Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng</p>

    <p>Whose sails were never to the tempest given</p>



    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="false" direct="true">Gosh it's <time when="18:00:00"><num type="cardinal" value="6">six</num> o'clock</time> already</said>. She starts walking up and down the room again. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="false" direct="true">I am borne darkly fearfully afar. . . . </said> The phone rings. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello. . . .

Oh, do I'd love to see you. Come by and we'll have a bite to eat on the way to the theater. . . . It's the <num type="ordinal" value="3">third</num> floor."</said></p>

<p>She rings off and gets a raincape out of a closet. The smell of furs and mothballs and dresses clings in her nostrils. She throws up the window again and breathes deep of the wet air full of the cold rot of autumn. She hears the burring boom of a big steamer from the river. Darkly, fearfully afar from this nonsensical life, from this fuzzy idiocy and strife; a man can take a ship for his wife, but a girl. The telephone is shiveringly beadily ringing, ringing.</p>

<p>The buzzer burrs at the same time. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> presses the button to click the latch. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello. . . . No, I'm very sorry I'm afraid you'll have to tell me who it is.

<p><said who="#CassandraWilkins" aloud="true" direct="true">"I felt I just had to see you. . . .

<p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh what a beautiful apartment you have,"</said> <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename> </persName> is exclaiming at the same moment. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName>'s ears ring sickeningly. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"We all have to die sometime,"</said> gruffly she blurts out.</p>

<p><persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename></persName>'s rubberclad foot is tapping the floor; she catches <persName ref="#CassandraWilkins"><addName type="nickname">Cassie</addName></persName>'s eye and makes her stammer into silence. <said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Hadnt</orig> we better go along?

<p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Excuse me <time dur-iso="PT1M">a minute</time> <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename> </persName>."</said> <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> runs into the bathroom and slams the door. She sits on the edge of the bathtub pounding on her knees with her clenched fists. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="false" direct="true">Those women'll drive me mad.</said> Then the tension in her snaps, she feels something draining out of her like water out of a washbasin. She quietly puts a dab of rouge on her lips.</p>

<p>When she goes back she says in her usual voice: <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well let's get along. . . . Got a part yet <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename></persName>?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"I had a chance to go out to <placeName><settlement type="city">Detroit</settlement></placeName> with a stock company. I turned it down. ...

<p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"What <orig>wouldnt</orig> I give for a chance to get away from <placeName><settlement type="city">New York</settlement></placeName>. . . .

<p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> picks up her umbrella and the <num type="cardinal" value="3">three</num> women file down the stairs and out into the street. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Taxi,"</said> calls <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName>.</p>

<p>The passing car grinds to a stop. The red hawk face of the <occupation>taxidriver</occupation> craning into the light of the street lamp. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Go to <placeName>Eugenie's</placeName> on <address><num type="ordinal" value="48">Fortyeighth</num> Street</address>,"</said> says <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> as the others climb in. Greenish lights and darks flicker past the lightheaded windows.</p>

<p>She stood with her arm in the arm of <persName ref="#HarryGoldweiser"><forename>Harry</forename> <surname>Goldweiser</surname></persName>'s dinner jacket looking out over the parapet of the roof garden. Below them the Park lay twinkling with occasional lights, streaked with nebular blur like a fallen sky. From behind them came gusts of a tango, inklings of voices, shuffle of feet on a dancefloor. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> felt a stiff castiron figure in her metalgreen evening dress.</p>

<p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"Ah but <persName>Boirnhardt</persName>, <persName ref="#RachelGoldweiser"><forename>Rachel</forename></persName>, Duse, <persName><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Siddons</surname></persName>. . . .

All they want's a <occupation>detective</occupation> melodrama or a rotten <nationality>French</nationality> farce with the kick left out or a lot of pretty girls and music.

<p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"I think that this city is full of people wanting inconceivable things. . . . Look at it."</said></p>

<p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's all right at night when you <orig>cant</orig> see it. There's no artist sense, no beautiful buildins, no old-time air, that's what's the matter with it."</said></p>

<p>They stood a while without speaking. The orchestra began playing the waltz from <title>The Lilac Domino</title>. Suddenly <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> turned to <persName ref="#HarryGoldweiser"><surname>Goldweiser</surname></persName> and said in a curt tone.</p>

<p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Can you understand a woman who wants to be a harlot, a common tart, sometimes?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#HarryGoldweiser" aloud="true" direct="true">"My dear young lady what a strange thing for a sweet lovely girl to suddenly come out and say."</said></p>

<p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"I suppose you're shocked."</said> She <orig>didnt</orig> hear his answer. She felt she was going to cry. She pressed her sharp nails into the palms of her hands, she held her breath until she had counted <num type="cardinal" value="20">twenty</num>. Then she said in a choking little girl's voice, <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#HarryGoldweiser"><forename>Harry</forename></persName> let's go and dance a little."</said></p>

<p>The sky above the cardboard buildings is a vault of beaten lead. It would be less raw if it would snow. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> finds a taxi on the corner of <address><num type="ordinal" value="7">Seventh</num> Avenue</address> and lets herself sink back in the seat rubbing the numb gloved fingers of<num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> hand against the palm of the other. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"<address>West <num type="ordinal" value="57">Fiftyseventh</num></address>, please."</said> Out of a sick mask of fatigue she watches fruitstores, signs, buildings being built, trucks, girls, <occupation>messengerboys</occupation>, <occupation>policemen</occupation> through the jolting window. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="false" direct="true">If I have my child, <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName>'s child, it will grow up to jolt up <address><num type="ordinal" value="7">Seventh</num> Avenue</address> under a sky of beaten lead that never snows watching fruitstores, signs, buildings being built, trucks, girls, <occupation>messengerboys</occupation>, <occupation>policemen</occupation>. . . .</said> She presses her knees together, sits up straight on the edge of the seat with her hands clasped over her slender belly. O God the rotten joke they've played on me, taking <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName> away, burning him up, leaving me nothing but this growing in me that's going to kill me. She's whimpering into her numb hands. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="false" direct="true">O God why <orig>wont</orig> it snow?</said></p>

<p>As she stands on the gray pavement fumbling in her purse for a bill, a dusteddy swirling scraps of paper along the gutter fills her mouth with grit. The <occupation>elevatorman</occupation>'s face is round ebony with ivory inlay. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Staunton</surname> <surname sort="2">Wells</surname></persName>?"</said> <said aloud="true" direct="true">"Yas ma'am <num type="ordinal" value="8">eighth</num> floor."</said></p>

<p>The elevator hums as it soars. She stands looking at herself in the narrow mirror. Suddenly something recklessly gay goes through her. She rubs the dust off her face with a screwedup handkerchief, smiles at the <occupation>elevatorman</occupation>'s smile that's wide as the full keyboard of a piano, and briskly rustles to the door of the apartment that a frilled maid opens. Inside it smells of tea and furs and flowers, women's voices chirp to the clinking of cups like birds in an aviary. Glances flicker about her head as she goes into the room.</p>

<p>There was wine spilled on the tablecloth and bits of tomatosauce from the spaghetti. The restaurant was a steamy place with views of the <geogName>Bay of <settlement type="city">Naples</settlement></geogName> painted in soupy blues and greens on the walls. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> sat back in her chair from the round tableful of young men, watching the smoke from her cigarette crinkle spirally round the fat <orgName>Chianti</orgName> bottle in front of her. In her plate a slab of tri-color icecream melted forlornly. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But good God <orig>hasnt</orig> a man some rights?

<p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"He's right all the same,"</said> he growled back at her. . . .</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"The result has been to put more power in the hands of a few men than there has been in the history of the world since the horrible slave civilizations of <placeName><country>Egypt</country></placeName> and <placeName><country>Mesopotamia</country></placeName>. . . ."</said></p>

<p><address><num type="ordinal" value="8">Eighth</num> Avenue</address> was full of fog that caught at their throats. Lights bloomed dimly through it, faces loomed, glinted in silhouette and faded like a fish in a muddy aquarium.</p>

    <p>They walked on without speaking. Wheels rumbled through the muffling fog underlaid with the groping distant lowing of sirens and steamboatwhistles on the river.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"But at least you have a career. . . . You like your work, you're enormously successful,"</said> said <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName> at the corner of <address><num type="ordinal" value="14">Fourteenth</num> Street</address>, and caught her arm as they crossed.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Dont</orig> say that. . . . You really <orig>dont</orig> believe it. I <orig>dont</orig> kid myself as much as you think I do."</said></p>

<p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"It used to be before I met <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName>, before I loved him. . . .

<p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> you're the only person left I can really talk to."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Dont</orig> want to trust me. I might go berserk on you too some day."</said></p>



    <p>They laughed.</p>

The fog was like a tent round about them. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm going to have a baby. . . . <persName ref="#StanwoodEmery"><addName type="nickname">Stan</addName></persName>'s baby.

       <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh no."</said> Her voice broke and her eyes filled with tears. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm a silly fool, that's all."</said> She screwed up her face like a little child and ran up the steps with the tears streaming down her face.</p>

       <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> I want to say something to you . . ."</said></p>

       <p>The door closed behind her.</p>

       <p><persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename> <surname>Herf</surname></persName> stood stockstill at the foot of the brownstone steps. His temples throbbed. He wanted to break the door down after her. He dropped on his knees and kissed the step where she had stood. The fog swirled and flickered with colors in confetti about him. Then the trumpet feeling ebbed and he was falling through a black manhole. He stood stockstill. A <occupation>policeman</occupation>'s ballbearing eyes searched his face as he passed, a stout blue column waving a nightstick. Then suddenly he clenched his fists and walked off. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>O</orig> God everything is hellish,"</said> he said aloud. He wiped the grit off his lips with his coatsleeve.</p>

    <p>She puts her hand in his to jump out of the roadster as the ferry starts, <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Thanks <persName ref="#LarryHopkins"><forename>Larry</forename></persName>,"</said> and follows his tall ambling body out on the bow. A faint riverwind blows the dust and gasoline out of their nostrils. Through the pearly night the square frames of houses along the Drive opposite flicker like burnedout fireworks. The waves slap tinily against the shoving bow of the ferry. A hunchback with a violin is scratching <title>Marianela</title>.</p>

    <p><said who="#LarryHopkins" aloud="true" direct="true">"Nothing succeeds like success,"</said> <persName ref="#LarryHopkins"><forename>Larry</forename></persName> is saying in a deep droning voice.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh if you knew how little I cared about anything just now you <orig>wouldnt</orig> go on teasing me with all these words. . . . You know, marriage, success, love, they're just words."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#LarryHopkins" aloud="true" direct="true">"But they mean everything in the world to me. . . . I think you'd like it in <placeName><settlement type="city">Lima</settlement></placeName> <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Elaine</addName></persName>. . . . I waited until you were free, <orig>didnt</orig> I? And now here I am."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"We're none of us that ever. . . . But I'm just numb."</said> The riverwind is brackish. Along the viaduct above <address><num type="ordinal" value="125">125th</num> Street</address> cars crawl like beetles. As the ferry enters the slip they hear the squudge and rumble of wheels on asphalt.</p>

    <p><said who="#LarryHopkins" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well we'd better get back into the car, you wonderful creature <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Elaine</addName></persName>."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"After all day it's exciting <orig>isnt</orig> it <persName ref="#LarryHopkins"><forename>Larry</forename></persName>, getting back into the center of things."</said></p>

    <p>Beside the smudged white door are <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> pushbuttons marked <floatingText>Night Bell</floatingText> and <floatingText>Day Bell</floatingText>. She rings with a shaky finger, A short broad man with a face like a rat and sleek black hair brushed straight back opens. Short dollhands the color of the flesh of a mushroom hang at his sides. He hunches his shoulders in a bow.</p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Are you the lady? Come in."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Is this <persName><roleName type="occupation" full="abb">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Abrahms</surname></persName>?"</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Yes. . . . You are the lady my friend phoned me about. Sit down my dear lady."</said> The office smells of something like arnica. Her heart joggles desperately between her ribs.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"You understand . . ."</said> She hates the quaver in her voice; she's going to faint. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"You understand, <persName><roleName type="occupation" full="abb">Dr.</roleName> <surname>Abrahms</surname></persName> that it is absolutely necessary. I am getting a divorce from my husband and have to make my own living."</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Very young, unhappily married . . . I am sorry."</said> The <occupation>doctor</occupation> purrs softly as if to himself. He heaves a hissing sigh and suddenly looks in her eyes with black steel eyes like gimlets. <said aloud="true" direct="true">"Do not be afraid, dear lady, it is a very simple operation. . . . Are you ready now?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Yes. It <orig>wont</orig> take very long will it? If I can pull myself together I have an engagement for tea at five."</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"You are a brave young lady. In <time dur-iso="PT1H">an hour</time> it will be forgotten. . . . I am sorry. . . . It is very sad such a thing is necessary. . . . Dear lady you should have a home and many children and a loving husband . . . Will you go in the operating room and prepare yourself. . . . I work without an assistant."</said></p>

    <p>The bright searing bud of light swells in the center of the ceiling, sprays razorsharp nickel, enamel, a dazzling sharp glass case of sharp instruments. She takes off her hat and lets herself sink shuddering sick on a little enamel chair. Then she gets stiffly to her feet and undoes the band of her skirt.</p>

    <p>The roar of the streets breaks like surf about a <distinct type="taboo">hell</distinct> of throbbing agony. She watches the tilt of her leather hat, the powder, the rosed cheeks, the crimson lips that are a mask on her face. All the buttons of her gloves are buttoned. She raises her hand. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Taxi!"</said> A fire engine roars past, a hosewagon with sweatyfaced men pulling on rubber coats, a clanging hookandladder. All the feeling in her fades with the dizzy fade of the siren. A wooden <nationality>Indian</nationality>, painted, with a hand raised at the streetcorner.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Taxi!"</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Yes ma'am."</said></p>

    <p>Later, sitting in the uptown express in the subway, she still could feel his soft hand patting her gloved hand. <said who="#BillyWaldron" aloud="true" direct="true">"Good-by little girl, God bless you,"</said> he'd said huskily.

It is something alive that grows in flesh, eats all your life, leaves you horrible, rotten. . . . The people opposite stared straight ahead of them, young men and young women, middleaged people, green faces in the dingy light, under the sourcolored advertisements. <said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="false" direct="true"><num type="cardinal" value="4">Four</num> Out of Every <num type="cardinal" value="5">Five</num>. . .</said> A trainload of jiggling corpses, nodding and swaying as the express roared shrilly towards <address><num type="ordinal" value="96">Ninetysixth</num> Street</address>.

    <p>They walked back towards <placeName><district>Manhattan</district></placeName>, the way she had come. Under them the <geogFeat>river</geogFeat> glinted through the mist.

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"I feel kinder fussed about it."</said></p>

    <p>The jazzband in the restaurant was playing Hindustan. It smelled of chop suey and <nationality>Chinese</nationality> sauce. They slipped into a booth. Slickhaired young men and little bobhaired girls were dancing hugged close. As they sat down they smiled into each other's eyes.</p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Jez I'm hungry."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"Are you <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName>?"</said></p>

    <p>When they got up to dance they were trembling so they could barely keep time to the music.</p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Dont</orig> talk like that. . . I <orig>dont</orig> like it."</said></p>

    <p>They walked leaning together in the darkness up the muddy rutted riverside streets, between huge swelling gas-tanks, brokendown fences, long manywindowed warehouses. At a corner under a streetlamp a boy catcalled as they passed.</p>



    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'll poke your face in you little <distinct type="swearing">bastard</distinct>," <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName> let fly out of the corner of his mouth.</p>

    <p>They slipped through a little door in a tall fence above which crazy lumberpiles towered. They could smell the <geogFeat>river</geogFeat> and cedarwood and sawdust. They could hear the <geogFeat>river</geogFeat> lapping at the piles under their feet. <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName> drew her to him and pressed his mouth down on hers.</p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Hay <orig>dere</orig> <orig>dont</orig> you know you <orig>cant</orig> come out here at night disaway?"</said> a voice yapped at them. The <occupation>watchman</occupation> flashed a lantern in their eyes.</p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right keep your shirt on, we were just taking a little walk."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Some walk."</said></p>

    <p>They were dragging themselves down the street again with the black riverwind in their teeth.</p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Look out."</said> A <occupation>policeman</occupation> passed whistling softly to himself. They drew apart. <said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh <persName ref="#Francie">Francie</persName> they'll be takin us to the nuthouse if we keep this up. Let's go to your room."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"Landlady'll throw me out, that's all."</said></p>

    <p>They walked up mudtracked stairs to the top floor of the tenement.</p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"Take off your shoes,"</said> she hissed in his ear as she slipped the key in the lock.</p>

    <p><said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"I got holes in my stockings."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"That <orig>dont</orig> matter, silly. I'll see if it's all right. My room's way back past the kitchen so if they're all in bed they <orig>cant</orig> hear us."</said></p>

    <p>When she left him he could hear his heart beating. In <time dur-iso="PT1S">a second</time> she came back. He tiptoed after her down a creaky hall. A sound of snoring came through a door. There was a smell of cabbage and sleep in the hall. Once in her room she locked the door and put a chair against it under the knob. A triangle of ashen light came in from the street. <said who="#Francie" aloud="true" direct="true">"Now for crissake keep still <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName>."</said> One shoe still in each hand he reached for her and hugged her. He lay beside her whispering on and on with his lips against her ear. <said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"And <persName ref="#Francie">Francie</persName> I'll make good, honest I will; I got to be a <occupation>sergeant</occupation> overseas till they busted me for goin A.W.O.L.

Jez <persName ref="#Francie">Francie</persName> you'd like it."</said></p>

    <p>They were walking to dinner through the snow. Big snowfeathers spun and spiraled about them mottling the glare of the streets with blue and pink and yellow, blotting perspectives.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> I hate to have you take that job. . . . You ought to keep on with your acting."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Is this the place?"</said> They stood before an unlighted basement door covered by a closemeshed grating. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Let's try."</said></p>



    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Did the bell ring?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"I think so."</said></p>

    <p>The inner door opened and a girl in a pink apron peered out at them. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"<foreign xml:lang="fr">Bon soir mademoiselle</foreign>."</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Ah . . . <foreign xml:lang="fr">bon soir monsieur 'dame</foreign>."</said> She ushered them into a foodsmelling gaslit hall hung with overcoats and hats and mufflers. Through a curtained door the restaurant blew in their faces a hot breath of bread and cocktails and frying butter and perfumes and lipsticks and clatter and jingling talk.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"I can smell absinthe,"</said> said <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName>. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Let's get terribly tight."</said></p>

    <p>He stood bulky at the end of the corridor beckoning to them.

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"No I <orig>cant</orig>,"</said> said <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> laughing. They were at a little marble table in the corner of the crowded kitchen. A girl was dishing out at a deal table in the center. <num type="cardinal" value="2">Two</num> cooks worked over the stove. The air was rich with sizzling fatty foodsmells. <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> hobbled back to them with <num type="cardinal" value="3">three</num> glasses on a small tray.

    <p><said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"<foreign xml:lang="fr">Salut</foreign>,"</said> he said, raising his glass. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"Absinthe cocktail, like they make it in <placeName><settlement type="city">New Orleans</settlement></placeName>."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's a knockout."</said> <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> took a card out of his vest pocket:</p>

    <p><said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"Neither did I."</said></p>

    <p>When <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> limped away from their table silence came down between them like an asbestos curtain in a theater.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"He's a funny duck,"</said> said <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> forcing a laugh.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"He certainly is."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> let's have another cocktail."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Allright."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I must get hold of him and get some stories about bootleggers out of him."</said></p>

    <p>When he stretched his legs out under the table he touched her feet. She drew them away. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> could feel his jaws chewing, they clanked so loud under his cheeks he thought <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> must hear them. She sat opposite him in a gray tailoredsuit, her neck curving up heartbreakingly from the ivory V left by the crisp frilled collar of her blouse, her head tilted under her tight gray hat, her lips made up; cutting up little pieces of meat and not eating them, not saying a word.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gosh . . . let's have another cocktail."</said> He felt paralyzed like in a nightmare; she was a porcelaine figure under a bellglass. A current of fresh snowrinsed air from somewhere eddied all of a sudden through the blurred packed jangling glare of the restaurant, cut the reek of food and drink and tobacco. For an instant he caught the smell of her hair. The cocktails burned in him. God I <orig>dont</orig> want to pass out.</p>

    <p>Sitting in the restaurant of the <placeName>Gare de Lyon</placeName>, side by side on the black leather bench. His cheek brushes hers when he reaches to put herring, butter, sardines, anchovies, sausage on her plate. They eat in a hurry, gobbling, giggling, gulp wine, start at every screech of an engine. . . .</p>

    <p>The train pulls out of <placeName><settlement type="city">Avignon</settlement></placeName>, they <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> awake, looking in each other's eyes in the compartment full of sleep-sodden snoring people. He lurches clambering over tangled legs, to smoke a cigarette at the end of the dim oscillating corridor. Diddledeump, going south, Diddledeump, going south, sing the wheels over the rails down the valley of the Rhone. Leaning in the window, smoking a broken cigarette, trying to smoke a crumbling cigarette, holding a finger over the torn place. Glubglub glubglub from the bushes, from the silverdripping poplars along the track.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"EUie, <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> there are nightingales singing along the track."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh I was asleep darling."</said> She gropes to him stumbling across the legs of sleepers. Side by side in the window in the lurching jiggling corridor.</p>

    <p>Deedledeump, going south. Gasp of nightingales along the track among the silverdripping poplars. The insane cloudy night of moonlight smells of gardens garlic rivers freshdunged field roses. Gasp of nightingales.</p>

    <p>Opposite him the <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Elliedoll</addName></persName> was speaking. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"He says the lobstersalad's all out. . . . <orig>Isnt</orig> that discouraging?"</said></p>

    <p>Suddenly he had his tongue. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gosh if that were the only thing."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"What do you mean?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why did we come back to this rotten town anyway?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"You've been burbling about how wonderful it was ever since we came back."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I know. I guess it's sour grapes. . . . I'm going to have another cocktail. . . . <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> for heaven's sake what's the matter with us?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"We're going to be sick if we keep this up I tell you."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well let's be sick. . . . Let's be good and sick."</said></p>



    <p>When they sit up in the great bed they can see across the harbor, can see the yards of a windjammer and a white sloop and a red and green toy tug and plainfaced houses opposite beyond a peacock stripe of water; when they lie down they can see gulls in the sky. At dusk dressing rockily, shakily stumbling through the mildewed corridors of the hotel out into streets noisy as a brass band, full of tambourine rattle, brassy shine, crystal glitter, honk and whir of motors. . . . Alone together in the dusk drinking sherry under a broad-leaved plane, alone together in the juggled particolored crowds like people invisible. And the spring night comes up over the sea terrible out of <placeName><bloc type="continent">Africa</block></placeName> and settles about them.</p>

    <p>They had finished their coffee. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> had drunk his very slowly as if some agony waited for him when he finished it.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I was afraid we'd find the <persName><surname>Barneys</surname></persName> here,"</said> said <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName>.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"You brought them here yourself <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName>. . . . And that dreadful woman insisted on talking babies with me all the evening. I hate talking babies."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gosh I wish we could go to a show."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"It would be too late anyway."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"And just spending money I <orig>havent</orig> got. . . . Lets have a cognac to top off with. I don't care if it ruins us."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"It probably will in more ways than one."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName>, here's to the breadwinner who's taken up the white man's burden."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Life's just temporary for that matter."</said></p>

    <p>The taxi drew up. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> paid him with his last <measure type="currency">dollar</measure>. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> had her key in the outside door. The street was a confusion of driving absintheblurred snow. The door of their apartment closed behind them. Chairs, tables, books, windowcurtains crowded about them bitter with the dust of yesterday, the day before, the day before that. Smells of diapers and coffeepots and typewriter oil and <nationality>Dutch</nationality> Cleanser oppressed them. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> put out the empty milkbottle and went to bed. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> kept walking nervously about the front room. His drunkenness ebbed away leaving him icily sober. In the empty chamber of his brain a doublefaced word clinked like a coin: Success Failure, Success Failure.</p>

    <p><said who="#AnnaCohen" aloud="true" direct="true">I'm just wild about <persName ref="#HarryGoldweiser"><forename><orig>Harree</orig></forename></persName></p>

    <p>And <persName ref="#AnnaCohen"><forename>Harry</forename></persName>'s just wild about me</said></p>

    <p>she hums under her breath as she dances. It's a long hall with a band at <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> end, lit greenishly by <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> clusters of electric lights hanging among paper festoons in the center. At the end where the door is, a varnished rail holds back the line of men.

    <p>Glowworm trains shuttle in the gloaming through the foggy looms of spiderweb bridges, elevators soar and drop in their shafts, harbor lights wink.</p>

    <p>Like sap at the <num type="ordinal" value="1">first</num> frost at <time when="17:00:00"><num type="cardinal" value="5">five</num> o'clock</time> men and women begin to drain gradually out of the tall buildings downtown, grayfaced throngs flood subways and tubes, vanish underground.</p>

    <p>All night the great buildings stand quiet and empty, their <num type="cardinal" value="1000000">million</num> windows dark. Drooling light the ferries chew tracks across the lacquered harbor. At <time when="00:00:00">midnight</time> the fourfunneled express steamers slide into the dark out of their glary berths. <occupation>Bankers</occupation> blearyeyed from secret conferences hear the hooting of the tugs as they are let out of side doors by lightningbug <occupation>watchmen</occupation>; they settle grunting into the back seats of limousines, and are whisked uptown into the Forties, clinking streets of ginwhite whiskey-yellow ciderfizzling lights.</p>

She stands <time dur-iso="PT1S">a second</time> with the tiny puff poised looking at her broad face with the bangs across the forehead and the straight black bobbed hair.

    <p>Dougan was waiting in the outer office. He sidled up mysteriously. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well <persName ref="#JoeOKeefee"><forename>Joe</forename></persName>, how's things?"</said></p>

    <p>The steam of cooking wrenched at his knotted stomach as he passed <placeName>Child's</placeName>.

He walked east past the hotel on <address><num type="ordinal" value="15">Fifteenth</num></address>. A colored man was sweeping off the steps. <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName> looked at him enviously; he's got a job. Milk wagons jingled by. On <address>Stuyvesant Square</address> a <occupation>milkman</occupation> brushed past him with a bottle in each hand. <persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName> stuck out his jaw and talked tough. <said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"Give us a swig <orig>o</orig> milk will yez?"</said> The <occupation>milkman</occupation> was a frail pinkfaced youngster.

Jez I ddin't need to talk rough like that. He waited until the boy came back. <said who="#DutchRobertson" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Thankye</orig> buddy, that was mighty white."</said></p>

    <p>He walked into the chilly park and sat down on a bench. There was hoarfrost on the asphalt. He picked up a torn piece of pink evening newspaper. <floatingtext><measure type="currency"><num type="cardinal" value="500000">$500,000</num></measure> Holdup. <occupation>Bank Messenger</occupation> Robbed in <orgName>Wall Street</orgName> Rush Hour</floatingtext>.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#DutchRobertson"><forename>Dutch</forename></persName> felt his heart pounding as he read the column. He was cold all over. He got to his feet and began thrashing his arms about.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> stumped through the turnstile at the end of the L line. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename> <surname>Herf</surname></persName> followed him looking from <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> side to the other. Outside it was dark, a blizzard wind whistled about their ears. A single Ford sedan was waiting outside the station.</p>

    <p><said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"How you like, <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb"><orig>Meester</orig></roleName> <surname><orig>'Erf</orig></surname></persName>?"</said></p>

    <p>They walked along the road, dodging an occasional blue-steel glint of a puddle. The arclights had a look of shrunken grapes swaying in the wind. To the right and left were flickering patches of houses in the distance. They stopped at a long building propped on piles over the water. Pool; <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> barely made out the letters on an unlighted window. The door opened as they reached it. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><forename>Mike</forename></persName>,"</said> said <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName>. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"This is <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb"><orig>Meester</orig></roleName> <surname><orig>'Erf</orig></surname></persName>, a <orig>frien'</orig> <orig>o</orig> mine."</said> The door closed behind them.

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Glad to meet you,"</said> said a voice.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Say how did you find my hand?"</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh I kin see in the dark."</said> The voice laughed throatily.</p>

    <p>By that time <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> had opened the inner door. Light streamed through picking out billiard tables, a long bar at the end, racks of cues. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"This is <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><forename>Mike</forename> <surname>Cardinale</surname></persName>,"</said> said <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName>. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> found himself standing beside a tall sallow shylooking man with bunchy black hair growing low on his forehead. In the inner room were shelves full of chinaware and a round table covered by a piece of mustardcolored oilcloth. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"Eh <foreign xml:lang="fr">la patronne</foreign>,"</said> shouted <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName>.

    <p><said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Havent</orig> you got a little peekmeup?"</said> said <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName>. He let himself down with a grunt into a chair.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><surname>Cardinale</surname></persName> set a fat fiasco of wine on the table and some glasses.

    <p><persName ref="#AnnetteCardinale"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Cardinale</surname></persName> set <num type="cardinal" value="6">six</num> plates with a stained fork, knife, and spoon in each and then put a steaming tureen of soup in the middle of the table.</p>

    <p><said who="#AnnetteCardinale" aloud="true" direct="true">"Pronto pasta,"</said> she shrieked in a guineahen voice.</p>

    <p><said who="#MikeCardinale" aloud="true" direct="true">"Thisa <persName ref="#AnnetteCardinale"><addName type="nickname">Anetta</addName></persName>,"</said> said <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><surname>Cardinale</surname></persName> as a pinkcheeked blackhaired girl with long lashes curving back from bright black eyes ran into the room followed by a heavily tanned young man in khaki overalls with curly sunbleached hair. They all sat down at once and began to eat the peppery thick vegetable chowder, leaning far over their plates.</p>

    <p>When <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> had finished his soup he looked up. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><forename>Mike</forename></persName> did you see lights?"</said> <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><surname>Cardinale</surname></persName> nodded. <said who="#MikeCardinale" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sure <orig>ting</orig> . . . be here any time."</said> While they were eating a dish of fried eggs and garlic, frizzled veal cutlets with fried potatoes and broccoli, <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName> began to hear in the distance the pop pop pop of a motorboat. <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> got up from the table with a motion to them to be quiet and looked out the window, cautiously lifting a corner of the shade, <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"That him,"</said> he said as he stumped back to the table. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"We eat good here, eh <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb"><orig>Meester</orig></roleName> Erf</persName>?"</said></p>

    <p>The young-man got to his feet wiping his mouth on his forearm. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Got <measure type="currency">a nickel</measure> <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName>,"</said> he said doing a double shuffle with his sneakered feet. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Here go Johnny."</said> The girl followed him out into the dark outer room. In a moment a mechanical piano started tinkling out a waltz. Through the door <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> could see them dancing in and out of the oblong of light. The chugging of the motorboat drew nearer. <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> went out, then <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><surname>Cardinale</surname></persName> and his wife, until <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> was left alone sipping a glass of wine among the debris of the dinner. He felt excited and puzzled and a little drunk. Already he began to construct the story in his mind. From the road came the grind of gears of a truck, then of another. The motorboat engine choked, backfired and stopped. There was the creak of a boat against the piles, a swash of waves and silence. The mechanical piano had stopped. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> sat sipping his wine. He could smell the rankness of salt marshes seeping into the house. Under him there was a little lapping sound of the water against the piles. Another motorboat was beginning to sputter in the far distance.</p>

    <p><said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"Got <measure type="currency">a nickel</measure>?"</said> asked <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> breaking into the room suddenly. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"Make music. . . . Very funny night tonight. Maybe you and <persName ref="#AnnetteCardinale"><forename>Annette</forename></persName> keep piano goin. I <orig>didnt</orig> see <persName>Mc Gee</persName> about landin. . . . Maybe somebody come. Must be veree quick."</said> <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> got to his feet and started fishing in his pockets. By the piano he found <persName ref="#AnnetteCardinale"><forename>Annette</forename></persName>. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Wont</orig> you dance?"</said> She nodded. The piano played <title>Innocent Eyes</title>. They danced distractedly. Outside were voices and footsteps. <said who="#AnnetteCardinale" aloud="true" direct="true">"Please,"</said> she said all at once and they stopped dancing. The <num type="ordinal" value="2">second</num> motorboat had come very near; the motor coughed and rattled still. <said who="#AnnetteCardinale" aloud="true" direct="true">"Please stay here,"</said> she said and slipped away from him.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename><surname>Herf</surname></persName> walked up and down uneasily puffing on a cigarette. He was making up the story in his mind. . . . In a lonely abandoned dancehall on <placeName>Sheepshead <geogFeat>Bay</geogFeat></placeName> . . . lovely blooming <nationality>Italian</nationality> girl . . . shrill whistle in the dark. . . . I ought to get out and see what's going on. He groped for the front door. It was locked. He walked over to the piano and put another <measure type="currency">nickel</measure> in. Then he lit a fresh cigarette and started walking up and down again. Always the way . . . a parasite on the drama of life, reporter looks at everything through a peephole. Never mixes in. The piano was playing <title>Yes We Have No Bananas</title>. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh hell!"</said> he kept muttering and ground his teeth and walked up and down.</p>

    <p>Outside the tramp of steps broke into a scuffle, voices snarled. There was a splintering of wood and the crash of breaking bottles. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> looked out through the window of the diningroom. He could see the shadows of men struggling and slugging on the boatlanding. He rushed into the kitchen, where he bumped into <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> sweaty and staggering into the house leaning on a heavy cane.</p>

    <p><said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"<distinct type="swearing">Goddam</distinct>. . . <orig>dey</orig> break my leg,"</said> he shouted.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Good God."</said> <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> helped him groaning into the diningroom.</p>

    <p>When <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> got back to him, <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> was sitting in a chair nursing his stump with his <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> hands.

He had a deep gash over his eyes from which a trickle of blood ran down his cheek on his coat and shirt. His wife followed him rolling back her eyes; she had a basin and a sponge with which she kept making ineffectual dabs at his forehead. He pushed her away. <said who="#MikeCardinale" aloud="true" direct="true">"I crowned <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> of em good wid a piece o pipe. I think he fell in de water.

    <p><said who="#MikeCardinale" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh shut up,"</said> growled <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><surname>Cardinale</surname></persName>. He had dropped into a chair and his wife was sponging off his face. <said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"Did you get a good look at the boat?"</said> asked <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName>.</p>

    <p><said who="#CongoJake" aloud="true" direct="true">"But how they know how we make landin?"</said> stuttered <persName ref="#CongoJake"><addName type="nickname">Congo</addName></persName> his face purple.</p>

    <p>Joggling home in the empty train through empty <placeName><district>Brooklyn</district></placeName> suburbs <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> tried to think of the bootlegging story he'd write for the <title>Sunday Magazine Section</title>. The girl's pink cheeks and toobright eyes kept intervening, blurring the orderly arrangement of his thoughts. He sank gradually into dreamier and dreamier reverie. Before the kid was born <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> sometimes had toobright eyes like that. The time on the hill when she had suddenly wilted in his arms and been sick and he had left her among the munching, calmly staring cows on the grassy slope and gone to a shepherd's hut and brought back milk in a wooden ladle, and slowly as the mountains hunched up with evening the color had come back into her cheeks and she had looked at him that way and said with a dry little laugh: It's the little Herf inside me. God why <orig>cant</orig> I stop mooning over things that are past And when the baby was coming and <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> was in the <title><nationality>American</nationality> Hospital</title> at <placeName>Neuilly</placeName>, himself wandering distractedly through the fair, going into the <placeName>Flea Circus</placeName>, riding on merrygorounds and the steam swing, buying toys, candy, taking chances on dolls in a crazy blur, stumbling back to the hospital with a big plaster pig under his arm. Funny these fits of refuge in the past. Suppose she had died; I thought she would. The past would have been complete all round, framed, worn round your neck like a cameo, set up in type, molded on plates for the <title>Magazine Section</title>, like the <num type="ordinal" value="1">first</num> of <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="birth"><persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="birth">James</addName></persName></addName><surname>Herf</surname></persName>'s articles on <title>The Bootlegging Ring</title>. Burning slugs of thought kept dropping into place spelled out by a clanking linotype.</p>

    <p>At <time when="00:00:00">midnight</time> he was walking across <address><num type="ordinal" value="14">Fourteenth</num></address>. He <orig>didnt</orig> want to go home to bed although the rasping cold wind tore at his neck and chin with sharp ice claws. He walked west across <address><num type="ordinal" value="7">Seventh</num></address> and <address><num type="ordinal" value="8">Eighth</num> Avenues</address>, found the name <persName ref="#RoySheffield"><forename>Roy</forename> <surname>Sheffield</surname></persName> beside a bell in a dimly lit hall. As soon as he pressed the bell the catch on the door began to click. He ran up the stairs. <persName ref="#RoySheffield"><forename>Roy</forename></persName> had his big curly head with its glass gray gollywog eyes stuck out the door.</p>

    <p><said who="#RoySheffield" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName>; come on in; we're all lit up like churches."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#JamesMeravile"><forename>James</forename> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName>'s face was crimson.

    <p>Outside the broad office windows the night is gray and foggy. Here and there a few lights make up dim horizontals and perpendiculars of asterisks. <persName ref="#PhineasBlackhead"><forename>Phineas</forename> <surname>Blackhead</surname></persName> sits at his desk tipping far back in the small leather armchair. In his hand protecting his fingers by a large silk handkerchief, he holds a glass of hot water and bicarbonate of soda. <persName ref="#MrDensch"><surname>Densch</surname></persName> bald and round as a billiardball sits in the deep armchair playing with his tortoises <distinct type="taboo">hell</distinct> spectacles.

When his partner has gone he lies back <time dur-iso="PT1S">a second</time> with his eyes closed. His face takes on the mottled color of ashes, his big fleshy frame is shrinking like a deflating balloon. At length he gets to his feet with a groan. Then he takes his hat and coat and walks out of the office with a slow heavy step. The hall is empty and dimly lit. He has to wait a long while for the elevator. The thought of holdup men sneaking through the empty building suddenly makes him catch his breath. He is afraid to look behind him, like a child in the dark. At last the elevator shoots up.</p>

    <p><said who="#PhineasBlackhead" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName><forename>Wilmer</forename></persName>,"</said> he says to the night <occupation>watchman</occupation> who runs it, <said who="#PhineasBlackhead" aloud="true" direct="true">"there ought to be more light in these halls at night. . . .

    <p>They are crossing <address><num type="ordinal" value="14">Fourteenth</num></address>. Father and daughter look out through the glass at the windbitten faces of people waiting to cross the street.</p>



    <p><persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename> <surname>Herf</surname></persName> yawned and scraped back his chair. The <measure type="currency">nickel</measure> glints of the typewriter hurt his eyes. The tips of his fingers were sore. He pushed open the sliding doors a little and peeped into the cold bedroom. He could barely make out <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> asleep in the bed in the alcove. At the far end of the room was the baby's crib. There was a faint milkish sour smell of babyclothes. He pushed the doors to again and began to undress. If we only had more space, he was muttering; we live cramped in our squirrelcage. . . . He pulled the dusty cashmere off the couch and yanked his pyjamas out from under the pillow. Space space cleanness quiet; the words were gesticulating in his mind as if he were addressing a vast auditorium.</p>

    <p>He turned out the light, opened a crack of the window and dropped wooden with sleep into bed. Immediately he was writing a letter on a linotype. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="false" direct="true">Now I lay me down to sleep . . . mother of the great white twilight.</said> The arm of the linotype was a woman's hand in a long white glove. Through the clanking from behind amber foots <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName>'s voice <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true"><orig>Dont</orig>, <orig>dont</orig>, <orig>dont</orig>, you're hurting me so. . . . <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Herf</surname></persName>, says a man in overalls, you're hurting the machine and we <orig>wont</orig> be able to get out the bullgod edition thank dog.</said> The linotype was a gulping mouth with nickelbright rows of teeth, gulped, crunched. He woke up sitting up in bed. He was cold, his teeth were chattering. He pulled the covers about him and settled to sleep again. The next time he woke up it was daylight. He was warm and happy. Snowflakes were dancing, hesitating, spinning, outside the tall window.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName>,"</said> said <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> coming towards him with a tray.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"No it's Sunday morning. . . . I thought you needed a little luxury. . . . I made some corn muffins."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"No. I was thinking if you could get another room to sleep in somewhere round, then nobody'd ever disturb you in the morning."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"But <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> we'd never see each other. . . . We hardly ever see each other as it is."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#MartinHerf"><forename>Martin</forename></persName>'s crying came in a gust from the other room. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> sat on the edge of the bed with the empty coffeecup on his knees looking at his bare feet. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Just as you like,"</said> he said dully. An impulse to grab her hands to crush her to him until he hurt her went up through him like a rocket and died. She picked up the coffeethings and swished away. His lips knew her lips, his arms knew the twining of her arms, he knew the deep woods of her hair, he loved her. He sat for a long time looking at his feet, lanky reddish feet with swollen blue veins, shoebound toes twisted by stairs and pavements. On each little toe there was a corn. He found his eyes filling with pitying tears. The baby had stopped crying. <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> went into the bathroom and started the water running in the tub.</p>

    <p><said who="#Elmer" aloud="true" direct="true">"It was that other feller you had <persName ref="#AnnaCohen"><forename>Anna</forename></persName>. He got you to <orig>thinkin</orig> you <orig>didnt</orig> give a damn. . . . He made you a fatalist."</said></p>

    <p>They are walking slowly up <address><num type="ordinal" value="2">Second</num> Avenue</address> through a foggy evening. He is a rustyhaired thinfaced young <nationality>Jew</nationality> with sunken cheeks and livid pale skin. He has the bandy legs of a garment worker. <persName ref="#AnnaCohen"><forename>Anna</forename></persName>'s shoes are too small for her. She has deep rings under her eyes. The fog is full of strolling groups talking Yiddish, overaccented East Side <nationality>English</nationality>, <nationality>Russian</nationality>. Warm rifts of light from delicatessen stores and softdrink stands mark off the glistening pavement.</p>

    <p><said who="#AnnaCohen" aloud="true" direct="true">"If I didn't feel so tired all the time,"</said> mutters <persName ref="#AnnaCohen"><forename>Anna</forename></persName>.</p>

He was talking in a low impersonal voice. <said who="#Elmer" aloud="true" direct="true">"The trouble with the workers is we <orig>dont</orig> know nothin, we <orig>dont</orig> know how to eat, we <orig>dont</orig> know how to live, we <orig>dont</orig> know how to protect our rights. . . .

    <p><persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> looked at himself in the mirror as he washed his hands in the Httle washroom behind his office. His hair that still grew densely down to a point on his forehead was almost white. There was a deep line at each corner of his mouth and across his chin. Under his bright gimleteyes the skin was sagging and granulated. When he had wiped his hands slowly and meticulously he took a little box of strychnine pills from the upper pocket of his vest, swallowed one, and feeling the anticipated stimulus tingle through him went back into his office. A longnecked <occupation>officeboy</occupation> was fidgeting beside his desk with a card in his hand.</p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"A lady wants to speak to you sir."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"Has she an appointment? Ask <persName><roleName type="honorific">Miss</roleName> <surname>Ranke</surname></persname>. . . . Wait <time dur-iso="PT1M">a minute</time>. Show the lady right through into this office."</said></p>

    <p>The card read <persName ref="#NellieMcNiel"><forename>Nellie</forename> <forename sort="2">Linihan</forename> <surname>McNiel</surname></persName>. She was expensively dressed with a lot of lace in the opening of her big fur coat. Round her neck she had a lorgnette on an amethyst chain.</p>

    <p><said who="#NellieMcNiel" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#GusMcNiel"><forenamme>Gus</forenamme></persName> asked me to come to see you,"</said> she said as he motioned her into a chair beside the desk.</p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"What can I do for you?"</said> His heart for some reason was pounding hard.</p>

    <p>She looked at him a moment through her lorgnette. <said who="#NellieMcNiel" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName> you stand it better than <persName ref="#GusMcNiel"><forename>Gus</forename></persName> does."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"What?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NellieMcNiel" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh all this. . . . I'm trying to get <persName ref="#GusMcNiel"><forename>Gus</forename></persName> to go away with me for a rest abroad . . . Marianbad or something like that . . . but he says he's in too deep to pull up his stakes."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"I guess that's true of all of us,"</said> said <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> with a cold smile.</p>

    <p>They were silent <time dur-iso="PT1M">a minute</time>, then <persName ref="#NellieMcNiel"><forename>Nellie</forename> <surname>McNiel</surname></persName> got to her feet. <said who="#NellieMcNiel" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look here <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forname>George</forname></persName>, <persName ref="#GusMcNiel"><forename>Gus</forename></persName> is awfully cut up about this. . . . You know he likes to stand by his friends and have his friends stand by him."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"Nobody can say that I <orig>havent</orig> stood by him. . . . It's simply this, I'm not a <occupation>politician</occupation>, and as, probably foolishly, I've allowed myself to be nominated for office, I have to run on a nonpartisan basis."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NellieMcNiel" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName> that's only half the story and you know it."</said></p>



    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"Tell him that I've always been and always shall be a good friend of his. . . . He knows that perfectly well. In this particular campaign I have pledged myself to oppose certain elements with which <persName ref="#GusMcNiel"><forename>Gus</forename></persName> has let himself get involved."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NellieMcNiel" aloud="true" direct="true">"You're a fine talker <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> and you always were."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> flushed. They stood stiff side by side at the office door. His hand lay still on the doorknob as if paralyzed. From the outer offices came the sound of typewriters and voices. From outside came the long continuous tapping of riveters at work on a new building.</p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"I hope your family's all well,"</said> he said at length with an effort.</p>

    <p><said who="#NellieMcNiel" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh yes they are all well thanks . . . <distinct type="old-fashioned">Goodby</distinct>."</said> She had gone.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> stood for a moment looking out of the window at the gray blackwindowed building opposite. Silly to let things agitate him so. Need of relaxation. He got his hat and coat from their hook behind the washroom door and went out.</p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName><surname>Jonas</surname></persName>,"</said> he said to a man with a round bald head shaped like a cantaloupe who sat poring over papers in the highceilinged library that was the central hall of the lawoffice, <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"bring everything up that's on my desk. . . . I'll go over it uptown tonight."</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"All right sir."</said></p>

    <p>When he got out on <address>Broadway</address> he felt like a small boy playing hooky. It was a sparkling winter afternoon with hurrying rifts of sun and cloud. He jumped into a taxi. Going uptown he lay back in the seat dozing. At <address><num type="ordinal" value="42">Forty-second</num> Street</address> he woke up. Everything was a confusion of bright intersecting planes of color, faces, legs, shop windows, trolleycars, automobiles. He sat up with his gloved hands on his knees, fizzling with excitement. Outside of <persName ref="#NevadaJones"><forename>Nevada</forename></persName>'s apartmenthouse he paid the taxi. The <occupation>driver</occupation> was a negro and showed an ivory mouthful of teeth when he got a <measure type="currency"><num type="cardinal" value="50">fifty</num>-cent</measure> tip. Neither elevator was there so <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> ran lightly up the stairs, half wondering at himself. He knocked on <persName ref="#NevadaJones"><forename>Nevada</forename></persName>'s door. No answer. He knocked again. She opened it cautiously. He could see her curly towhead. He brushed into the room before she could stop him. All she had on was a kimono over a pink chemise.</p>

    <p><said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"My God,"</said> she said, <said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"I thought you were the <occupation>waiter</occupation>."</said></p>

    <p>He grabbed her and kissed her. <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"I <orig>dont</orig> know why but I feel like a <age value="3">threeyear</age> old."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"You look like you was crazy with the heat. . . . I <orig>dont</orig> like you to come over without telephoning, you know that."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"You <orig>dont</orig> mind just this once I forgot."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> caught sight of something on the settee; he found himself staring at a pair of darkblue trousers neatly folded.</p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"I was feeling awfully fagged down at the office <persName ref="#NevadaJones"><forename>Nevada</forename></persName>. I thought I'd come up to talk to you to cheer myself up a bit."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"I was just practicing some dancing with the phonograph."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"Yes very interesting. . . ."</said> He began to walk springily up and down. <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"Now look here <persName ref="#NevadaJones"><forename>Nevada</forename></persName>. . . . We've got to have a talk. I <orig>dont</orig> care who it is you've got in your bedroom."</said> She looked suddenly in his face and sat down on the settee beside the trousers. <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"In fact I've known for some time that you and <persName ref="#TonyHunter"><forename>Tony</forename> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName> were carrying on."</said> She compressed her lips and crossed her legs. <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"In fact all this stuff and nonsense about his having to go to a <occupation>psychoanalyst</occupation> at <measure type="currency"><num type="cardinal" value="25">twentyfive</num> dollars</measure> <time dur-iso="PT1H">an hour</time> amused me enormously. . . . But just <time dur-iso="PT1M">this minute</time> I've decided I had enough. Quite enough."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName> you're crazy,"</said> she stammered and then suddenly she began to giggle.</p>

    <p><said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"I tell you what I'll do,"</said> went on <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName>in a clear legal voice, <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'll send you a check for <num type="cardinal" value="5">five</num> hundred, because you're a nice girl and I like you. The apartment's paid till the <num type="ordinal" value="1">first</num> of the month. Does that suit you? And please never communicate with me in any way."</said></p>

    <p>She was rolling on the settee giggling helplessly beside the neatly folded pair of darkblue trousers. <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> waved his hat and gloves at her and left closing the door very gently behind him. <said who="#GeorgeBaldwin" aloud="true" direct="true">Good riddance</said>, he said to himself as he closed the door carefully behind him.</p>

    <p>Down in the street again he began to walk briskly uptown. He felt excited and talkative. He wondered who he could go to see. Telling over the names of his friends made him depressed. He began to feel lonely, deserted. He wanted to be talking to a woman, making her sorry for the barrenness of his life. He went into a cigarstore and began looking through the phonebook. There was a faint flutter in him when he found the H's. At last he found the name <persName><surname>Herf</surname></persName>, <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Helena</addName> <surname>Oglethorpe</surname></persName>.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#NevadaJones"><forename>Nevada</forename> <surname>Jones</surname></persName> sat a long while on the settee giggling hysterically. At length <persName ref="#TonyHunter"><forename>Tony</forename> <surname>Hunter</surname></persName> came in in his shirt and drawers with his bow necktie perfectly tied.</p>

    <p><said who="#TonyHunter" aloud="true" direct="true">"Has he gone?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gone? sure he's gone, gone for good,"</said> she shrieked. <said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"He saw your damn pants."</said></p>

    <p>He let himself drop on a chair. <said who="#TonyHunter" aloud="true" direct="true">"O God if I'm not the unluckiest fellow in the world."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why?"</said> she sat spluttering with laughter with the tears running down her face.</p>

    <p><said who="#TonyHunter" aloud="true" direct="true">"Nothing goes right. That means it's all off about the matinees."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's back to <num type="cardinal" value="3">three</num> a day for little <persName ref="#NevadaJones"><forename>Nevada</forename></persName>. . . . I <orig>dont</orig> give a damn. . . . I never did like bein a kept woman."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#TonyHunter" aloud="true" direct="true">"But you're not thinking of my career. . . . Women are so selfish. If you hadn't led me on. . . ."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#NevadaJones" aloud="true" direct="true">"Shut up you little fool. <orig>Dont</orig> you think I <orig>dont</orig> know all about you?"</said> She got to her feet with the kimono pulled tight about her.</p>

    <p><said who="#TonyHunter" aloud="true" direct="true">"God all I needed was a chance to show what I could do, and now I'll never get it,"</said> <persName ref="#TonyHunter"><forename>Tony</forename></persName> was groaning.</p>

    <p><said who="" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sure you will if you do what I tell you. I set out to make a man of you kiddo and I'm goin to do it. . . . We'll get up an act. Old Hirshbein'll give us a chance, he used to be kinder smitten. . . . Come on now, I'll punch you in the jaw if you <orig>dont</orig>. Let's start thinkin up. . . . We'll come in with a dance number see . . . then you'll pretend to want to pick me up. . . . I'll be waitin for a streetcar . . . see . . . and you'll say Hello Girlie an I'll call Officer."</said></p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"Is that all right for length sir,"</said> asked the <occupation>fitter</occupation> busily making marks on the trousers with a piece of chalk.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#JamesMeravile"><forename>James</forename> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName> looked down at the <occupation>fitter</occupation>'s little greenish wizened bald head and at the brown trousers flowing amply about his feet. <said who="#JamesMeravile" aloud="true" direct="true">"A little shorter. . . . I think it looks a little old to have trousers too long."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why hello <persName ref="#JamesMeravile"><forename>James</forename> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName> I didn't know you bought your clothes at Brooks' too. <distinct type="slang">Gee</distinct> I'm glad to see you."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#JamesMeravile"><forename>James</forename> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName>'s blood stood still. He found himself looking straight in the blue alcoholic eyes of <persName ref="#JackCunningham"><forename>Jack</forename> <surename>Cunningham</surename></persName>. He bit his lip and tried to stare at him coldly without speaking.</p>

    <p><said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"God Almighty, do you know what we've done?"</said> cried out <persName ref="#JackCunningham"><surname>Cunningham</surname></persName>. <said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"We've bought the same suit of clothes. . . . I tell you it's identically the same."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#JamesMerivale"><forename>James</forename> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName> was looking in bewilderment from <persName ref="#JackCunningham"><surname>Cunningham</surname></persName>'s brown trousers to his own, the same color, the same tiny stripe of red and faint mottling of green.</p>

    <p><said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"Good God man <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> future brothersinlaw <orig>cant</orig> wear the same suit. People'll think it's a uniform. . . . It's ridiculous."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JamesMerivale" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well what are we going to do about it?"</said> <persName ref="#JamesMeravile"><forename>James</forename> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName> found himself saying in a grumbling tone.</p>

    <p><said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"We have to toss up and see who gets it that's all. . . . Will you lend me a quarter please?"</said> <persName ref="#JackCunningham"><surname>Cunningham</surname></persName> turned to his <occupation>salesman</occupation>. <said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right. . . . One toss, you yell."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JamesMeravile" aloud="true" direct="true">"Heads,"</said> said <persName ref="#JamesMeravile"><forename>James</forename> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName> mechanically.</p>

    <p><said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"The brown suit is yours. . . . Now I've got to choose another . . . God I'm glad we met when we did. Look,"</said> he shouted out through the curtains of the booth, <said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"why <orig>dont</orig> you have dinner with me tonight at the <placeName>Salmagundi Club</placeName>? . . . I'm going to be dining with the only man in the world who's crazier about hydroplanes than I am. . . . It's old man Perkins, you know him, he's <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> of the <occupation>vicepresidents</occupation> of your bank. . . . And look when you see <persName ref="#MaisieMerivale"><forename>Maisie</forename></persName> tell her I'm coming up to see her tomorrow. An extraordinary series of events has kept me from communicating with her . . . a most unfortunate series of events that took all my time up to this moment. . . . We'll talk about it later."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#JamesMerivale"><forename>James</forename> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName> cleared his throat. <said who="#JamesMerivale" aloud="true" direct="true">"Very well,"</said> he said dryly.</p>

    <p><said aloud="true" direct="true">"All right sir,"</said> said the <occupation>fitter</occupation> giving <persName ref="#JamesMerivale"><forename>James</forename> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName> a last tap on the buttocks. He went back into the booth to dress.</p>

    <p><said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right old thing,"</said> shouted <persName ref="#JackCunningham"><surname>Cunningham</surname></persName>, <said who="#JackCunningham" aloud="true" direct="true">"I've got to go pick out another suit . . . I'll expect you at seven. I'll have a Jack Rose waiting for you."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#JamesMerivale"><forename>James</forename> <surname>Merivale</surname></persName>'s hands were trembling as he fastened his belt. Perkins, <persName ref="#JackCunningham"><forename>Jack</forename> <surname>Cunningham</surname></persName>, the damn blackguard, hydroplanes. <persName ref="#JackCunningham"><forename>Jack</forename> <surname>Cunningham</surname></persName> Salmagundi Perkins. He went to a phone booth in a corner of the store and called up his mother. <said who="#JamesMerivale" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello Mother, I'm afraid I <orig>wont</orig> be up to dinner. . . . I'm dining with <persName>Randolph Perkins</persName> at the <placeName>Salmagundi Club</placeName>. . . . Yes it is very pleasant. . . . Oh well he and I have always been fairly good friends. . . . Oh yes it's essential to stand in with the men higher up. And I've seen <persName ref="#JackCunningham"><forename>Jack</forename> <surname>Cunningham</surname></persName>. I put it up to him straight from the shoulder man to man and he was very much embarrassed.

I felt I owed it to <persName ref="#MaisieMerivale"><forename>Maisie</forename></persName>. I tell you I think the man's a blackguard but until there's proof. . . . Well good night dear, in case I'm late. Oh no please <orig>dont</orig> wait up. Tell <persName ref="#MaisieMerivale"><forename>Maisie</forename></persName> not to worry I'll be able to give her the fullest details. Good night mother."</said></p>

    <p>They sat at a small table in the back of a dimly lighted tearoom. The shade on the lamp cut off the upper parts of their faces. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> had on a dress of bright peacock blue and a small blue hat with a piece of green in it. <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename><surname>Prynne</surname></persName>'s face had a sagging tired look under the street makeup.</p>

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Elaine</addName></persName>, you've just got to come,"</said> she was saying in a whiny voice, <said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#CassandraWilkins"><addName type="nickname">Cassie</addName></persName>'ll be there and <persName ref="#JohnOglethorpe"><surname>Oglethorpe</surname></persName> and all the old gang. . . . After all now that you're making such a success of editorial work it's no reason for completely abandoning your old friends is it? You <orig>dont</orig> know how much we talk and wonder about you."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"No but <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename> </persName> it's just that I'm getting to hate large parties. I guess I must be getting old. All right I'll come for a little while."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename> </persName> put down the sandwich she was nibbling at and reached for <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName>'s hand and patted it. <said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"That's the little trouper. . . . Of course I knew you were coming all along."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"But <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename> </persName> you never told me what happened to that traveling repertory company last summer. . . ."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"O my God,"</said> burst out <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename> </persName>. <said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"That was terrible.

Oh I <orig>cant</orig> tell about it any more. . . . It <orig>isnt</orig> funny to me any more, it's just horrible. . . . Oh <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Elaine</addName></persName> I'm so discouraged. My dear I'm getting old."</said> She suddenly burst out crying.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename></persName> please <orig>dont</orig>,"</said> said <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> in a little rasping voice.

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"Dear you <orig>dont</orig> understand . . . You never will understand."</said></p>

    <p>They sat a long while without saying anything, scraps of lowvoiced conversation came to them from other corners of the dim tearoom. The palehaired waitress brought them <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> orders of fruit salad.</p>

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"My it must be getting late,"</said> said <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename></persName> eventually.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's only <time when="20:30:00">half past <num type="cardinal" value="8">eight</num></time>. . . . We <orig>dont</orig> want to get to this party too soon."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"By the way . . . how's <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename> <surname>Herf</surname></persName>. I <orig>havent</orig> seen him for ages."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName> is fine. . . . He's terribly sick of newspaper work. I do wish he could get something he really enjoyed doing."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"He'll always be a restless sort of person. Oh <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Elaine</addName></persName> I was so happy when I heard about your being married. . . . I acted like a damn fool. I cried and cried. . . . And now with <persName ref="#MartinHerf"><forename>Martin</forename></persName> and everything you must be terribly happy."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh we get along all right. . . . <persName ref="#MartinHerf"><forename>Martin</forename></persName>'s picking up, <placeName><settlement type="city">New York</settlement></placeName> seems to agree with him.

Do you know <persName ref="#RuthPrynne"><forename>Ruth</forename></persName> I don't think I'd ever have another baby. . . . I was so horribly afraid he'd turn out deformed or something. . . . It makes me sick to think of it."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#RuthPrynne" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh but it must be wonderful though."</said></p>

    <p>They rang a bell under a small brass placque that read: <floatingText><persName ref="#HesterVoorhees"><forename>Hester</forename> <surname>Voorhees</surname></persName> Interpretation of the Dance</floatingText>. They went up <num type="cardinal" value="3">three</num> flights of creaky freshvarnished stairs.

    <p>They sat down on a couch in a recess between the dormer windows. Out of the corner of her eye she could see a girl dancing in green silk veils. The phonograph was playing the <title>Cesar Frank</title> symphony.</p>

    <p><said who="#JohnOglethorpe" aloud="true" direct="true">"We <orig>mustnt</orig> miss <persName ref="#CassandraWilkins"><addName type="nickname">Cassie</addName></persName>'s daunce. The poor girl would be dreadfully offended."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#CassandraWilkins" aloud="true" direct="true">"I suspected it my dear."</said> <persName ref="#CassandraWilkins"><addName ref="nickname">Cassia</addName></persName> was flitting selfconsciously by.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh do come and help me. . . . <persName ref="#JohnOglethorpe"><addName type="nickname">Jojo</addName></persName>'s teasing me terribly."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#CassandraWilkins" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I'll <orig>twy</orig> to sit down just for <time dur-iso="PT1S">a second</time>, I'm going to dance next. . . . <persName ref="#JohnOglethorpe"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Oglethorpe</surname></persName>'s going to wead his <orig>twanslation</orig> of <title>the songs of Bilitis</title> for me to dance to."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> looked from <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> to the other; <persName ref="#JohnOglethorpe"><surname>Oglethorpe </surname></persName> crooked his eyebrows and nodded.</p>

    <p>Then <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> sat alone for a long while looking at the dancing and the chittering crowded room through a dim haze of boredom.</p>

    <p>The record on the phonograph was <nationality>Turkish</nationality>. <persName ref="#HesterVoorhees"><forename>Hester</forename> <surname>Voorhees</surname></persName>, a skinny woman with a mop of hennaed hair cut short at the level of her ears, came out holding a pot of drawling incense out in front of her preceded by <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> young men who unrolled a carpet as she came. She wore silk bloomers and a clinking metal girdle and brassieres. Everybody was clapping and saying, <said aloud="true" direct="true">"How wonderful, how marvelous,"</said> when from another room came <num type="cardinal" value="3">three</num> tearing shrieks of a woman. Everybody jumped to his feet. A stout man in a derby hat appeared in the doorway. <said aloud="true" direct="true">"All right little goils, right through into the back room. Men stay here."</said></p>


    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Who are you anyway?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Never mind who I am, you do as I say."</said> The man's face was red as a beet under the derby hat.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's a <occupation>detective</occupation>." <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's outrageous. Let him show his badge."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's a holdup."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's a raid."</said></p>

    <p>The room had filled suddenly with <occupation>detectives</occupation>. They stood in front of the windows. A man in a checked cap with a face knobbed like a squash stood in front of the fireplace. They were pushing the women roughly into the back room. The men were herded in a little group near the door; <occupation>detectives</occupation> were taking their names. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> still sat on the couch. <said aloud="true" direct="true">". . . complaint phoned to headquarters,"</said> she heard somebody say. Then she noticed that there was a phone on the little table beside the couch where she sat. She picked it up and whispered softly for a number.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello is this the <occupation>district attorney</occupation>'s office? . . . I want to speak to <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> please. . . .   <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName>. . . . It's lucky I knew where you were. Is the <occupation>district attorney</occupation> there? That's fine . . . no you tell him about it. There has been a horrible mistake. I'm at <persName ref="#HesterVoorhees"><forename>Hester</forename> <surname>Voorhees</surname></persName>'; you know she has a dancing studio. She was presenting some dances to some friends and through some mistake the <orgname>police</orgname> are raiding the place . . ."</said></p>

    <p>The man in the derby was standing over her. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right phoning <orig>wont</orig> do no good. . . . Go 'long in the other room."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I've got the <occupation>district attorney</occupation>'s office on the wire. You speak to him. . . . Hello is this <persName><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Winthrop</surname></persName>? . . . Yes O . . . How do you do? Will you please speak to this man?"</said></p>

    <p>She handed the telephone to the <occupation>detective</occupation> and walked out into the center of the room. <said who="#" aloud="false" direct="true">My I wish I <orig>hadnt</orig> taken my hat off</said>, she was thinking.</p>

    <p>From the other room came a sound of sobbing and <persName ref="#HesterVoorhees"><forename>Hester</forename> <surname>Voorhees</surname></persName>' stagy voice shrieking, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's a horrible mistake. . . . I <orig>wont</orig> be insulted like this."</said></p>

    <p>The <occupation>detective</occupation> put down the telephone. He came over to <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName>. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I want to apologize miss. . . . We acted on insufficient information. I'll withdraw my men immediately."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You'd better apologize to <persName ref="#HesterVoorhees"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Voorhees</surname></persName>. . . . It's her studio."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well ladies and gents,"</said> the <occupation>detective</occupation> began in a loud cheerful voice, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"we've made a little mistake and we're very sorry. . . . Accidents will happen . . ."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> slipped into the side room to get her hat and coat. She stood some time before the mirror powdering her nose. When she went out into the studio again everybody was talking at once. Men and women stood round with sheets and bathrobes draped over their scanty dancingclothes. The <occupation>detectives</occupation> had melted away as suddenly as they came. <persName ref="#JohnOglethorpe"><surname>Oglethorpe</surname></persName> was talking in loud impassioned tones in the middle of a group of young men.</p>

    <p><said who="#JohnOglethorpe" aloud="true" direct="true">"The scoundrels to attack women,"</said> he was shouting, red in the face, waving his headdress in <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> hand. <said who="#JohnOglethorpe" aloud="true" direct="true">"Fortunately I was able to control myself or I might have committed an act that I should have regretted to my dying day. . . . It was only with the greatest selfcontrol. . ."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> managed to slip out, ran down the stairs and out into drizzly streets. She hailed a taxi and went home. When she had got her things off she called up <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename> <surname>Baldwin</surname></persName> at his house. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName>, I'm terribly sorry I had to trouble you and <persName><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Winthrop</surname></persName>. Well if you <orig>hadnt</orig> happened to say at lunch you'd be there all the evening they probably would be just piling us out of the black maria at the Jefferson Market Court. . . . Of course it was funny. I'll tell you about it sometime, but I'm so sick of all that stuff. . . . Oh just everything like that aesthetic dancing and literature and radicalism and psychoanalysis. . . . Just an overdose I guess. . . . Yes I guess that's it <persName ref="#GeorgeBaldwin"><forename>George</forename></persName> . . . I guess I'm growing up."</said></p>

    <p>The night was <num type="cardinal" value="1">one</num> great chunk of black grinding cold. The smell of the presses still in his nose, the chirrup of typewriters still in his ears, <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename><surname>Herf</surname></persName> stood in <address>City Hall Square</address> with his hands in his pockets watching ragged men with caps and earsflaps pulled down over faces and necks the color of raw steak shovel snow. Old and young their faces were the same color, their clothes were the same color. A razor wind cut his ears and made his forehead ache between the eyes.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname></persName>, think you'll take the job?"</said> said a milkfaced young man who came up to him breezily and pointed to the pile of snow. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why not, Dan. I <orig>dont</orig> know why it <orig>wouldnt</orig> be better than spending all your life rooting into other people's affairs until you're nothing but a <distinct type="taboo">goddam</distinct> traveling dictograph."</said></p>

    <p><said who="" aloud="true" direct="true">"It'd be a fine job in summer all right. . . . Taking the West Side?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm going to walk up. . . . I've got the heebyjeebies tonight."</said></p>

    <p><said who="" aloud="true" direct="true">"Jez man you'll freeze to death."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I <orig>dont</orig> care if I do. . . . You get so you <orig>dont</orig> have any private life, you're just an automatic writing machine."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I wish I could get rid of a little of my private life. . . . Well goodnight. I hope you find some private life <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName>."</said></p>

    <p>Laughing, <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename> <surname>Herf</surname></persName> turned his back on the snowshovelers and started walking up <address>Broadway</address>, leaning into the wind with his chin buried in his coatcollar. At <address>Houston Street</address> he looked at his watch. <time when="17:00:00"><num type="cardinal" value="5">Five</num> o'clock</time>. Gosh he was late today. Wouldnt be a place in the world where he could get a drink. He whimpered to himself at the thought of the icy blocks he still had to walk before he could get to his room. Now and then he stopped to pat some life into his numb ears. At last he got back to his room, lit the gasstove and hung over it tingling. His room was a small square bleak room on the south side of <address>Washington Square</address>. Its only furnishings were a bed, a chair, a table piled with books, and the gasstove. When he had begun to be a little less cold he reached under the bed for a basketcovered bottle of rum. He put some water to heat in a tin cup on the gasstove and began drinking hot rum and water. Inside him all sorts of unnamed agonies were breaking loose. He felt like the man in the fairy story with an iron band round his heart. The iron band was breaking.</p>

    <p>He had finished the rum. Occasionally the room would start going round him solemnly and methodically. Suddenly he said aloud: <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I've got to talk to her . . . I've got to talk to her."</said> He shoved his hat down on his head and pulled on his coat. Outside the cold was balmy. <num type="cardinal" value="6">Six</num> milkwagons in a row passed jingling.</p>

    <p>On <address>West <num type="ordinal" value="12">Twelfth</num></address> <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> black cats were chasing each other. Everywhere was full of their crazy yowling. He felt that something would snap in his head, that he himself would scuttle off suddenly down the frozen street eerily caterwauling.</p>

    <p>He stood shivering in the dark passage, ringing the bell marked <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><surname>Herf</surname> again and again. Then he knocked as loud as he could. <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><forename>Ellie<forename></persName> came to the door in a green wrapper.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"What's the matter <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName>? <orig>Havent</orig> you got a key?"</said> Her face was soft with sleep; there was a happy cozy suave smell of sleep about her. He talked through clenched teeth breathlessly.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> I've got to talk to you."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Are you lit, <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName>?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I know what I'm saying."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm terribly sleepy."</said></p>

    <p>He followed her into her bedroom. She kicked off her slippers and got back into bed, sat up looking at him with sleepweighted eyes.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Dont</orig> talk too loud on account of <persName ref="#MartinHerf"><forename>Martin</forename></persName>."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName> I <orig>dont</orig> know why it's always so difficult for me to speak out about anything. . . . I always have to get drunk to speak out. . . . Look here do you like me any more?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"You know I'm awfully fond of you and always shall be."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I mean love, you know what I mean, whatever it is . . ."</said> he broke in harshly.</p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"I guess I <orig>dont</orig> love anybody for long unless they're dead. . . . I'm a terrible sort of person. It's no use talking about it."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I knew it. You knew I knew it. O God things are pretty rotten for me <persName ref="#EllenThatcher"><addName type="nickname">Ellie</addName></persName>."</said></p>

    <p>She sat with her knees hunched up and her hands clasped round them looking at him with wide eyes. <said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Are you really so crazy about me <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName>?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look here lets get a divorce and be done with it."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Dont</orig> be in such a hurry, <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName>. . . . And there's <persName ref="#MartinHerf"><forename>Martin</forename></persName>. What about him?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I can scrape up enough money for him occasionally, poor little kid."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"I make more than you do, <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName>. . . . You <orig>shouldnt</orig> do that yet."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"I know. I know. <orig>Dont</orig> I know it?"</said></p>

    <p>They sat looking at each other without speaking. Their eyes burned from looking at each other. Suddenly <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><forename>Jimmy</forename></persName> wanted terribly to be asleep, not to remember anything, to let his head sink into blackness, as into his mother's lap when he was a kid.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I'm going home."</said> He gave a little dry laugh. <said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"We didn't think it'd all go pop like this, did we?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#EllenThatcher" aloud="true" direct="true">"Goodnight <persName ref="#JimmyHerf"><addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName></persName>,"</said> she whined in the middle of a yawn.</p>

    <p><said who="#JimmyHerf" aloud="true" direct="true">"But things <orig>dont</orig> end. . . . If only I <orig>weren'</orig> so terribly sleepy. . . . Will you put out the light?"</said></p>

    <p>He groped his way in the dark to the door. Outside the arctic morning was growing gray with dawn. He hurried back to his room. He wanted to get into bed and be asleep before it was light.</p>

    <p>A long low room with long tables down the middle piled with silk and crêpe fabrics, brown, salmonpink, emeraldgreen. A smell of snipped thread and dress materials. All down the tables bowed heads auburn, blond, black, brown of girls sewing. Errandboys pushing rolling stands of hung dresses up and down the aisles. A bell rings and the room breaks out with noise and talk shrill as a birdhouse.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#AnnaCohen"><forename>Anna</forname></persName> gets up and stretches out her arms. <said who="#AnnaCohen" aloud="true" direct="true">"My I've got a head,"</said> she says to the girl next her.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Up last night?"</said></p>

    <p>She nods.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Ought to quit it dearie, it'll spoil your looks. A girl <orig>cant</orig> burn the candle at both ends like a feller can."</said> The other girl is thin and blond and has a crooked nose. She puts her arm round <persName ref="#AnnaCohen"><forename>Anna</forname></persName>'s waist. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"My I wish I could put on a little of your weight."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#AnnaCohen" aloud="true" direct="true">"I wish you could,"</said> says <persName ref="#AnnaCohen"><forename>Anna</forname></persName>. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Dont</orig> matter what I eat it turns to fat."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Still you <distinct type="informal"><orig>aint</orig></distinct> too fat. . . . You're juss plump so's they like to squeeze ye. You try wearing boyishform like I told an you'll look fine."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#AnnaCohen" aloud="true" direct="true">"My boyfriend says he likes a girl to have shape."</said></p>

    <p>On the stairs they push their way through a group of girls listening to a little girl with red hair who talks fast, opening her mouth wide and rolling her eyes. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">". . . She lived just on the next block at <address><num type="cardinal" value="2230">2230</num> Cameron Avenue</address> an she'd been to the <placeName>Hippodrome</placeName> with some girlfriends and when they got home it was late an they let her go home alone, up <address>Cameron Avenue</address>, see? <orig>An</orig> the next morning when her folks began looking for her they found her behind a Spearmint sign in a back lot."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Was she dead?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sure she was. . . . A negro had done somethin terrible to her and then he'd strangled her. . . . I felt terrible.

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sure I saw all about it in the paper last night. Imagine livin right on the next block."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Did you see me touch that hump back?"</said> cried <persName ref="#Rosie"><forename>Rosie</forename></persName> as he settled down beside her in the taxi. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"In the lobby of the theater?"</said> He pulled at the trousers that were tight over his knees. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"That's goin to give us luck <persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><forename>Jake</forename></persName>. I never seen a hump back to fail. . . . if you touch him on the hump . . . Ou it makes me sick how fast these taxis go."</said> They were thrown forward by the taxi's sudden stop. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"My God we almost ran over a boy."</said> <persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><forename>Jake</forename> <surname>Silverman</surname></persName> patted her knee. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Poor ikle kid, was it all worked up?"</said> As they drove up to the hotel she shivered and buried her face in her coatcollar. When they went to the desk to get the key, the clerk said to <persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><surname>Silverman</surname></persName>, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"There's a gentleman waiting to see you sir."</said> A thickset man came up to him taking a cigar out of his mouth. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Will you step this way <time dur-iso="PT1M">a minute</time> please <persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Silverman</surname></persName>."</said> <persName ref="#Rosie"><forename>Rosie</forename></persName> thought she was going to faint. She stood perfectly stilly frozen, with her cheeks deep in the fur collar of her coat.</p>

    <p>They sat in <num type="cardinal" value="2">two</num> deep armchairs and whispered with their heads together. Step by step, she got nearer, listening. <said who="#JakeSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"Warrant . . . Department of Justice . . . using the mails to defraud . . ."</said> She <orig>couldnt</orig> hear what <persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><forename>Jake</forename></persName> said in between. He kept nodding his head as if agreeing. Then suddenly he spoke out smoothly, smiling.</p>

    <p><said who="" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I've heard your side <persName><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Rogers</surname></persName>. . . . Here's mine.

    <p><said who="" aloud="true" direct="true">"I <orig>cant</orig> help that. . . . My duty is to execute the warrant. . . . I'm afraid I'll have to search your room. . . . You see we have several little items . . ."</said> The man flicked the ash off his cigar and began to read in a monotonous voice. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"<persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><forename type="birth">Jacob</forename> <surname>Silverman</surname></persName>, alias <persName><forename>Edward</forename> <surname>Faversham</surname></persName>, <persName><forename>Simeon</forename> J. <surname>Arbuthnot</surname></persName>, <persName><forename>Jack</forename> <surname>Hinkley</surname></persName>,<persName>J. J. <surname>Gold<surname></persName>. . . . Oh we've got a pretty little list. . . . We've done some very pretty work on your case, if I do say it what <orig>shouldnt</orig>."</said></p>



    <p>They got to their feet. The man with the cigar jerked his head at a lean man in a cap who sat reading a paper on the opposite side of the lobby.</p>

    <p><persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><surname>Silverman</surname></persName> walked over to the desk. <said who="#JakeSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm called away on business,"</said> he said to the clerk. <said who="#JakeSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"Will you please have my bill prepared? <persName><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mrs.</roleName> <surname>Silverman</surname></persName> will keep the room for a few days."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#Rosie"><forename>Rosie</forename></persName> <orig>couldnt</orig> speak. She followed the <num type="cardinal" value="3">three</num> men into the elevator. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sorry to have to do this maam,"</said> said the lean <occupation>detective</occupation> pulling at the visor of his cap. <persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><surname>Silverman</surname></persName> opened the room door for them and closed it carefully behind him.</p>

    <p><said who="#JakeSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"Thank you for your consideration, gentlemen. . . . My wife thanks you."</said> <persName ref="#Rosie"><forename>Rosie</forename></persName> sat in a straight chair in the corner of the room. She was biting her tongue hard, harder to try to keep her lips from twitching.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"We realize <persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><roleName type="honorific" full="abb">Mr.</roleName> <surname>Silverman</surname></persName> that this is not quite the ordinary criminal case."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JakeSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"<orig>Wont</orig> you have a drink gentlemen?"</said></p>

    <p>They shook their heads. The thickset man was lighting a fresh cigar.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Allright <persName ref="#MikeCardinale"><forename>Mike</forename></persName>,"</said> he said to the lean man. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Go through the drawers and closet."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#JakeSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"Is that regular?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"If this was regular we'd have the handcuffs on you and be running the lady here as an accessory."</said></p>

    <p><persName ref="#Rosie"><forename>Rosie</forename></persName> sat with her icy hands clasped between her knees swaying her body from side to side. Her eyes were closed. While the <occupation>detectives</occupation> were rummaging in the closet, <persName ref="#JakeSilverman"><surname>Silverman</surname></persName> took the opportunity to put his hand on her shoulder. She opened her eyes. <said who="#JakeSilverman" aloud="true" direct="true">"The minute the <distinct type="taboo">goddam</distinct> <distinct type="swearing">dicks</distinct> take me out phone <persName><surname>Schatz</surname></persName> and tell him everything. Get hold of him if you have to wake up everybody in <placeName><settlement type="city">New York</settlement></placeName>."</said> He spoke low and fast, his lips barely moving.</p>
