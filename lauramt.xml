                    <p>Morning clatters with the first L train down <address>Allen Street</address>. Daylight rattles through the windows, shaking the old brick houses, splatters the girders of the L structure with bright confetti.</p>
                    
                    <p>The cats are leaving the garbage cans, the chinches are going back into the walls, leaving sweaty limbs, leaving the grimetender necks of little children asleep. Men and women stir under blankets and bedquilts on mattresses in the corners of rooms, clots of kids begin to untangle to scream and kick.</p>
                    
                    <p>At the corner of <address>Riverton</address> <!-- ricontrollare --> the old man with the hempen beard who sleeps where nobody knows is putting out his picklestand. Tubs of gherkins, pimentos, melonrind, piccalilli give out twining vines and cold tendrils of dank pepperyfragrance that grow like a marshgarden out of the musky bedsmells and the rancid clangor of the cobbled awakening street.</p>
                    
                    <p>The old man with the hempen beard who sleeps where nobody knows sits in the midst of it like Jonah <!-- ricontrollare --> under his gourd.</p>

                    </person> walked up four creaky flights and knocked at a white door fingermarked above the knob where the name Sunderland appeared in old English characters on a card neatly held in place by brass thumbtacks. He waited a long while beside a milkbottle, two creambottles, and a copy of the Sunday Times. There was a rustle behind the door and the creak of a step, then no more sound. He pushed a white button in the doorjamb.</p>

                    <p>An orchestra was playing When It's Appleblossom Time in Normandee. The place was full of smokewrithing slants of sunlight, paper festoons, signs announcing Lobsters Arrive Daily, Eat Clams Now, Try Our Delicious French Style Steamed Mussles (Recommended by the Department of Agriculture).

                    <p>Sunlight dripped in her face through the little holes in the brim of her straw hat. She was walking with brisk steps too short on account of her narrow skirt; through the thin china silk the sunlight tingled like a hand stroking her back. In the heavy heat streets, stores, people in Sunday clothes, strawhats, sunshades, surfacecars, taxis, broke and crinkled brightly about her grazing her with sharp cutting glints as if she were walking through piles of metalshavings. She was groping continually through a tangle of gritty sawedged brittle noise.</p>

                    <p>At Lincoln Square a girl rode slowly through the traffic on a white horse; chestnut hair hung down in even faky waves over the horse's chalky rump and over the giltedged saddlecloth where in green letters pointed with crimson, read Danderine. She had on a green Dolly Varden hat with a crimson plume; one hand in a white gauntlet nonchalantly jiggled at the reins, in the other wabbled a goldknobbed riding crop.</p>

                    <p>Ellen watched her pass; then she followed a smudge of green through a cross-street to the Park. A smell of trampled sunsinged grass came from boys playing baseball. All the shady benches were full of people. When she crossed the curving automobile road her sharp French heels sank into the asphalt. Two sailors were sprawling on a bench in the sun; one of them popped his lips as she passed, she could feel their seagreedy eyes cling stickily to her neck, her thighs, her ankles. She tried to keep her hips from swaying so much as she walked. The leaves were shriveled on the saplings along the path. South and east sunnyfaced buildings hemmed in the Park, to the west they were violet with shadow. Everything was itching sweaty dusty constrained by policemen and Sunday clothes. Why hadn't she taken the L? She was looking in the black eyes of a young man in a straw hat who was drawing up a red Stutz roadster to the curb. His eyes twinkled in hers, he jerked back his head smiling an upsidedown smile, pursing his lips so that they seemed to brush her cheek. He pulled the lever of the brake and opened the door with the other hand. She snapped her eyes away and walked on with her chin up. Two pigeons with metalgreen necks and feet of coral waddled out of her way. An old man was coaxing a squirrel to fish for peanuts in a paper bag.</p>

                    <p>All in green on a white stallion rode the Lady of the Lost Battalion. . . . Green, green, danderine . . . Godiva in the haughty mantle of her hair. . . .</p>

                    <p>General Sherman in gold interrupted her. She stopped a second to look at the Plaza that gleamed white as motherofpearl. . . . Yes this is Elaine Oglethorpe's apartment. . . . She climbed up onto a Washington Square bus. Sunday afternoon Fifth Avenue filed by rosily dustily jerkily. On the shady side there was an occasional man in a top hat and frock coat. Sunshades, summer dresses, straw hats were bright in the sun that glinted in squares on the upper windows of houses, lay in bright slivers on the hard paint of limousines and taxicabs. It smelled of gasoline and asphalt, of spearmint and talcumpowder and perfume from the couples that jiggled closer and closer together on the seats of the bus. In an occasional storewindow, paintings, maroon draperies, varnished antique chairs behind plate glass. The St. Regis. Sherry's. The man beside her wore spats and lemon gloves, a floorwalker probably. As they passed St. Patrick's she caught a whiff of incense through the tall doors open into gloom. Delmonico's. In front of her the young man's arm was stealing round the narrow gray flannel back of the girl beside him.</p>

                    <p>Eighth Street. She got down from the bus and went into the basement of the Brevoort.

                    <p>She looked at him laughing, balancing a small cherry tartlet that had one bite out of it between a pink squaretipped finger and thumb. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Is that the way you act when you've got some miserable sinner on the witnessbox?

                    <p>A young man stood at the table, swaying a little, looking down at them. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello Stan, where the dickens did you come from?"</said> Baldwin looked up at him without smiling. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look Mr. Baldwin I know it's awful rude, but may I sit down at your table a second. There's somebody looking for me who i just cant meet. O God that mirror! Still they'd never look for me if they saw you."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Miss Oglethorpe this is Stanwood Emery, the son of the senior partner in our firm."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh it's so wonderful to meet you Miss Oglethorpe. I saw you last night, but you didn't see me."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Did you go to the show?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I almost jumped over the foots I thought you were so wonderful."</said></p>

                    <p>He had a ruddy brown skin, anxious eyes rather near the bridge of a sharp fragillycut nose, a big mouth never still, wavy brown hair that stood straight up. Ellen looked from one to the other inwardly giggling. They were all three stiffening in their chairs.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I saw the danderine lady this afternoon,"</said> she said. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"She impressed me enormously. Just my idea of a great lady on a white horse."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"With rings on her finger and bells on her toes, And she shall make mischief wherever she goes."</said> Stan rattled it off quickly under his breath.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Music, isnt it?"</said> put in Ellen laughing. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I always say mischief."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well how's college?"</said> asked Baldwin in a dry uncordial voice.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I guess it's still there,"</said> said Stan blushing. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I wish they'd burn it down before I got back."</said> He got to his feet. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You must excuse me Mr. Baldwin. . . . My intrusion was infernally rude."</said> As he turned leaning towards Ellen she smelled his grainy whiskey breath. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Please forgive it, Miss Oglethorpe."</said></p>

                    <p>She found herself holding out her hand; a dry skinny hand squeezed it hard. He strode out with swinging steps bumping into a waiter as he went.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I cant make out that infernal young puppy,"</said> burst out Baldwin. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Poor old Emery's heartbroken about it. He's darn clever and has a lot of personality and all that sort of thing, but all he does is drink and raise Cain. . . . I guess all he needs is to go to work and get a sense of values. Too much money's what's the matter with most of those collegeboys. . . . Oh but Elaine thank God we're alone again. I have worked continuously all my life ever since I was fourteen. The time has come when I want to lay aside all that for a while. I want to live and travel and think and be happy. I cant stand the pace of downtown the way I used to. I want to learn to play, to ease off the tension. . . . That's where you come in."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But I don't want to be the nigger on anybody's safety-valve."</said> She laughed and let the lashes fall over her eyes.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Let's go out to the country somewhere this evening. I've been stifling in the office all day. I hate Sunday anyway."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But my rehearsal."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You could be sick. I'll phone for a car."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Golly there's Jojo. . . . Hello Jojo"</said>; she waved her gloves above her head.</p>

                    <p>John Oglethorpe, his face powdered, his mouth arranged in a careful smile above his standup collar, advanced between the crowded tables, holding out his hand tightly squeezed into buff gloves with black stripes. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Heow deo you deo, my deah, this is indeed a surprise and a pleajah."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You know each other, don't you? This is Mr. Baldwin."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Forgive me if I intrude . . . er . . .. upon a tête à tête."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Nothing of the sort, sit down and we'll all have a high-ball. . . . I was just dying to see you really Jojo. . . . By the way if you havent anything else to do this evening you might slip in down front for a few minutes. I want to know what you think about my reading of the part. . . ."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Certainly my deah, nothing could give me more pleajah."</said></p>

                    <p>His whole body tense George Baldwin leaned back with his hand clasped behind the back of his chair. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Waiter . . ."</said> He broke his words off sharp like metal breaking. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Three Scotch highballs at once please."</said></p>

                    <p>Oglethorpe rested his chin on the silver ball of his cane. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Confidence, Mr. Baldwin,"</said> he began, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"confidence between husband and wife is a very beautiful thing. Space and time have no effect on it. Were one of us to go to China for a thousand years it would not change our affection one tittle."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You see George, what's the matter with Jojo is that he read too much Shakespeare in his youth. . . . But I've got to go or Merton will be bawling me out again. . . . Talk about industrial slavery. Jojo tell him about Equity."</said></p>

                    <p>Baldwin got to his feet. There was a slight flush on his cheekbones. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Wont you let me take you up to the theater,"</said> he said through clenched teeth.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I never let anyone take me anywhere . . . And Jojo you must stay sober to see me act."</said></p>

                    <p>Fifth Avenue was pink and white under pink and white clouds in a fluttering wind that was fresh after the cloying talk and choke of tobaccosmoke and cocktails. She waved the taxistarter off merrily and smiled at him. Then she found a pair of anxious eyes looking into hers seriously out of a higharched brown face.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I waited round to see you come out. Cant I take you somewhere? I've got my Ford round the corner. . . . Please."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But I'm just going up to the theater. I've got a rehearsal.</said>></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right do let me take you there."</said></p>

                    <p>She began putting a glove on thoughtfully. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right, but it's an awful imposition on you."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"That's fine. It's right round here. . . . It was awfully rude of me to butt in that way, wasn't it? But that's another story. . . . Anyway I've met you. The Ford's name is Dingo, but that's another story too. . . ."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Still it's nice to meet somebody humanly young. There's nobody humanly young round New York."</said></p>

                    <p>His face was scarlet when he leaned to crank the car. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh I'm too damn young."</said></p>

                    <p>The motor sputtered, started with a roar. He jumped round and cut off the gas with a long hand. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"We'll probably get arrested; my muffler's loose and liable to drop off."</said></p>

                    <p>At Thirtyfourth Street they passed a girl riding slowly through the traffic on a white horse; chestnut hair hung down in even faky waves over the horse's chalky rump and over the giltedged saddlecloth where in green letters pointed with crimson read Danderine.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Rings on her fingers,"</said> chanted Stan pressing his buzzer, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"And bells on her toes, And she shall cure dandruff wherever it grows."</said></p>

                    <p>Noon sunlight spirals dimly into the chopsuey joint. Muted music spirals Hindustan. He eats fooyong, she eats chowmein. They dance with their mouths full, slim blue jumper squeezed to black slick suit, peroxide curls against black slick hair.</p>

                    <p>From Liverpool, British steamer Raleigh, Captain Kettlewell; 933 bales, 881 boxes, 10 baskets, 8 packages fabrics: 57 boxes, 89 bales, 18 baskets cotton thread: 156 bales felt: 4 bales asbestos: 100 sacks spools. . . .</p>

                    <p>JOE HARLAND stopped typing and looked up at the ceiling. The tips of his fingers were sore. The office smelled stalely of paste and manifests and men in shirt-sleeves. Through the open window he could see a piece of the dun wall of an airshaft and a man with a green eyeshade staring vacantly out of a window. The towheaded officeboy set a note on the corner of his desk: Mr. Pollock will see you at 5:10. A hard lump caught in his throat; he's going to fire me. His fingers started tapping again:</p>

                    <p>From Glasgow, Dutch steamer Delft, Captain Tromp; 200 bales, 123 boxes, 14 kegs. . . .</p>

                    <p>Joe Harland roamed about the Battery till he found an empty seat on a bench, then he let himself flop into it. The sun was drowning in tumultuous saffron steam behind Jersey. Well that's over. He sat a long while staring at the sunset like at a picture in a dentist's waiting room. Great whorls of smoke from a passing tug curled up black and scarlet against it. He sat staring at the sunset, waiting. That's eighteen dollars and fifty cents I had before, less six dollars for the room, one dollar and eighty-four cents for laundry, and four dollars and fifty cents I owe Charley, makes seven dollars and eighty-four cents, eleven dollars and eighty four cents, twelve dollars and thirty-four cents from eighteen dollars and fifty cents leaves me six dollars and sixteen cents, three days to find another job if I go without drinks. O God wont my luck ever turn; used to have good enough luck in the old days. His knees were trembling, there was a sick burning in the pit of his stomach.</p>

                    <p>A fine mess you've made of your life Joseph Harland. Forty-five and no friends and not a cent to bless yourself with.</p>

                    <p>The sail of a catboat was a crimson triangle when it luffed a few feet from the concrete walk. A young man and a young girl ducked together as the slender boom swung across. They both were bronzed with the sun and had yellow weather bleached hair. Joe Harland gnawed his lip to keep back the tears as the catboat shrank into the ruddy murk of the bay. By God I need a drink.

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Aint it a croime? Aint it a croime?"</said> The man in the seat to the left of him began to say over and over again. Joe Harland turned his head; the man had a red puckered face and silver hair. He held the dramatic section of the paper taut between two grimy flippers. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Them young actresses all dressed naked like that. . . . Why cant they let you alone."</said> <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">x"Dont you like to see their pictures in the papers?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why cant they let you alone I say. . . . If you aint got no work and you aint got no money, what's the good of em I say?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well lots of people like to see their pictures in the paper. Used to myself in the old days."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Used to be work in the old days. . . . You aint got no job now?" he growled savagely. Joe Harland shook his head.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well what the hell? They ought to leave you alone oughtn't they? Wont be no jobs till snow shoveling begins."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">What'll you do till then?"</said></p>

                    <p>The old man didnt answer. He bent over the paper again screwing up his eyes and muttering. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All dressed naked, it's a croime I'm teliin yez."</said></p>

                    <p>Joe Harland got to his feet and walked away.</p>

                    <p>It was almost dark; his knees were stiff from sitting still so long. As he walked wearily he could feel his potbelly cramped by his tight belt. Poor old warhorse you need a couple of drinks to think about things. A mottled beery smell came out through swinging doors. Inside the barkeep's face was like a russet apple on a snug mahogany shelf.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gimme a shot of rye."</said> The whiskey stung his throat hot and fragrant. Makes a man of me that does. Without drinking the chaser he walked over to the free lunch and ate a ham sandwich and an olive. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Let's have another rye Charley. That's the stuff to make a man of you. I been laying off it too much, that's what's the matter with me. You wouldnt think it to look at me now, would you friend, but they used to call me the Wizard of Wall Street which is only another illustration of the peculiar predominance of luck in human affairs. . . . Yes sir with pleasure. Well, here's health and long life and to hell with the jinx. . . . Hah makes a man of you . . . Well I suppose there's not one of you gentlemen here who hasnt at some time or other taken a plunger, and how many of you hasnt come back sadder and wiser. Another illustration of the peculiar predominance of luck in human affairs. But not so with me; gentlemen for ten years I played the market, for ten years I didn't have a ticker ribbon out of my hand day or night, and in ten years I only took a cropper three times, till the last time. Gentlemen I'm going to tell you a secret. I'm going to tell you a very important secret. . . . Charley give these very good friends of mine another round, my treat, and have a nip yourself. . . . My, that tickles her in the right place. . . . Gentlemen just another illustration of the peculiar predominance of luck in human affairs. Gentlemen the secret of my luck . . . this is exact I assure you; you can verify it yourselves in newspaper articles, magazines, speeches, lectures delivered in those days; a man, and a dirty blackguard he turned out to be eventually, even wrote a detective story about me called the Secret of Success, which you can find in the New York Public Library if you care to look the matter up. . . . The secret of my success was . . . and when you hear it you'll laugh among yourselves and say Joe Harland's drunk, Joe Harland's an old fool. . . . Yes you will. . . . For ten years I'm telling you I traded on margins, I bought outright, I covered on stocks I'd never even heard the name of and every time I cleaned up. I piled up money. I had four banks in the palm of my hand. I began eating my way into sugar and gutta percha, but in that I was before my time. . . . But you're getting nervous to know my secret, you think you could use it. . . . Well you couldnt. . . . It was a blue silk crocheted necktie that my mother made for me when I was a little boy. . . . Dont you laugh, God damn you. . . . No I'm not starting anything. Just another illustration of the peculiar predominance of luck. The day I chipped in with another fellow to spread a thousand dollars over some Louisville and Nashville on margin I wore that necktie. Soared twentyfive points in twentyfive minutes. That was the beginning. Then gradually I began to notice that the times I didnt wear that necktie were the times I lost money. It got so old and ragged I tried carrying it in my pocket. Didnt do any good. I had to wear it, do you understand? . . . The rest is the old old story gentlemen. . . . There was a girl, God damn her and I loved her. I wanted to show her that there was nothing in the world I wouldnt do for her so I gave it to her. I pretended it was a joke and laughed it off, ha ha ha. She said, Why it's no good, it's all worn out, and she threw it in the fire. . . . Only another illustration. . . . Friend you wouldn't set me up to another drink would you? I find myself unexpectedly out of funds this afternoon. . . . I thank you sir. . . . Ah that puts ginger in you again."</said></p>

                    <p>In the crammed subway car the messenger boy was pressed up against the back of a tall blond woman who smelled of Mary Garden. Elbows, packages, shoulders, buttocks, jiggled closer with every lurch of the screeching express. His sweaty Western Union cap was knocked onto the side of his head. If I could have a dame like dat, a dame like dat'd be wort havin de train stalled, de lights go out, de train wrecked. I could have her if I had de noive an de jack. As the train slowed up she fell against him, he closed his eyes, didnt breathe, his nose was mashed against her neck. The train stopped. He was carried in a rush of people out the door.</p>

                    <p>Dizzy he staggered up into the air and the blinking blocks of lights. Upper Broadway was full of people. Sailors lounged in twos and threes at the corner of Ninetysixth. He ate a ham and a leberwurst sandwich in a delicatessen store. The woman behind the counter had buttercolored hair like the girl in the subway but she was fatter and older. Still chewing the crust of the last sandwich he went up in the elevator to the Japanese Garden. He sat thinking a while with the flicker of the screen in his eyes. Jeze dey'll tink it funny to see a messengerboy up here in dis suit. I better get de hell outa here. I'll go deliver my telegrams.</p>

                    <p>He tightened his belt as he walked down the stairs. Then he slouched up Broadway to 105th Street and east towards Columbus Avenue, noting doors, fire escapes, windows, cornices, carefully as he went. Dis is de joint. The only lights were on the second floor. He rang the second floor bell. The doorcatch clicked. He ran up the stairs. A woman with weedy hair and a face red from leaning over the stove poked her head out.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Telegram for Santiono."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"No such name here."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sorry maam I musta rung de wrong bell."</said></p>

                    <p>Door slammed in his nose. His sallow sagging face tightened up all of a sudden. He ran lightly on tiptoe up the stairs to the top landing then up the little ladder to a trap-door. The bolt ground as he slid it back. He caught in his breath. Once on the cindergritty roof he let the trapdoor back softly into place. Chimneys stood up in alert ranks all about him, black against the glare from the streets. Crouching he stepped gingerly to the rear edge of the house, let himself down from the gutter to the fire escape. His foot grazed a flowerpot as he landed. Everything dark. Crawled through a window into a stuffy womansmelling room, slid a hand under the pillow of an unmade bed, along a bureau, spilled some facepowder, in tiny jerks pulled open the drawer, a watch, ran a pin into his finger, a brooch, something that crinkled in the back corner; bills, a roll of bills. Getaway, no chances tonight. Down the fire escape to the next floor. No light. Another window open. Takin candy from a baby. Same room, smelling of dogs and incense, some kind of dope. He could see himself faintly, fumbling, in the glass of the bureau, put his hand into a pot of cold cream, wiped it off on his pants. Hell. Something fluffysoft shot with a yell from under his feet. He stood trembling in the middle of the narrow room. The little dog was yapping loud in a corner.</p>

                    <p>The room swung into light. A girl stood in the open door, pointing a revolver at him. There was a man behind her.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What are you doing? Why it's a Western Union boy. . . ."</said> The light was a coppery tangle about her hair, picked out her body under the red silk kimono. The young man was wiry and brown in his unbuttoned shirt. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well what are you doing in that room?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Please maam it was hunger brought me to it, hunger an my poor ole muder starvin."</said></p>

                    <p>When he was outside the door she held out the dollarbill to him.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Jez you're white," he said choking. He grabbed the hand with the bill in it and kissed it; leaning over her hand kissing it wetly he caught a glimpse of her body under the arm in the drooping red silk sleeve. As he walked, still trembling, down the stairs, he looked back and saw the man and the girl standing side by side with their arms around each other watching him. His eyes were full of tears. He stuffed the dollarbill into his pocket.</p>

                    <p>Kid if you keep on bein a softie about women you're goin to find yourself in dat lil summer hotel up de river. . . . Pretty soft though. Whistling under his breath he walked to the L and took an uptown train. Now and then he put his hand over his back pocket to feel the roll of bills. He ran up to the third floor of an apartmenthouse that smelled of fried fish and coal gas, and rang three times at a grimy glass door. After a pause he knocked softly.</p>



                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Zat you Moike?"</said> came faintly the whine of a woman's voice.</p>

                    <p>A sharpfaced woman with henna hair opened the door. She had on a fur coat over frilly lace underclothes.</p>

On the table were used glasses and a bottle of Green River whiskey. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"She gave me a dollar an tole me to be a good little boy."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"The hell she did?"</said></p>

It's stage money ye simple saphead, you goddam . . ."</said></p>

                    <p>Giggling they sat side by side on the edge of the bed. Through the stuffy smell of the room full of little silky bits of clothing falling off chairs a fading freshness came from a bunch of yellow roses on the bureau. Their arms tightened round each other's shoulders; suddenly he wrenched himself away and leaned over her to kiss her mouth. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Some burglar,"</said> he said breathlessly.</p>

                    <p>Ellen gripped his hand hard as they came down the stairs stepping together. In front of the letterboxes in the shabby hallway he grabbed her suddenly by the shoulders and pressed her head back and kissed her. Hardly breathing they floated down the street toward Broadway. He had his hand under her arm, she squeezed it tight against her ribs with her elbow. Aloof, as if looking through thick glass into an aquarium, she watched faces, fruit in storewindows, cans of vegetables, jars of olives, redhotpokerplants in a florist's, newspapers, electric signs drifting by. When they passed cross-streets a puff of air came in her face off the river. Sudden jetbright glances of eyes under straw hats, attitudes of chins, thin lips, pouting lips, Cupid's bows, hungry shadow under cheekbones, faces of girls and young men nuzzled fluttering against her like moths as she walked with her stride even to his through the tingling yellow night.</p>

                    <p>Once out on Broadway again she felt very merry. She stood in the middle of the street waiting for the uptown car. An occasional taxi whizzed by her. From the river on the warm wind came the long moan of a steamboat whistle. In the pit inside her thousands of gnomes were building tall brittle glittering towers. The car swooped ringing along the rails, stopped. As she climbed in she remembered swooningly the smell of

                    <p>Ellen got off the car and walked east along the desolate empty pavements of 105th Street. A fetor of mattresses and sleep seeped out from the blocks of narrow-windowed houses. Along the gutters garbagecans stank sourly. In the shadow of a doorway a man and girl swayed tightly clamped in each other's arms. Saying good night. Ellen smiled happily. Greatest hit on Broadway. The words were an elevator carrying her up dizzily, up into some stately height where electric light signs crackled scarlet and gold and green, where were bright roofgardens that smelled of orchids, and the slow throb of a tango danced in a goldgreen dress with

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But my dear lady I assure you upon my honor as a gentleman. . ."</said></p>

                    <p>Mrs. Budkowitz began to jerk her shoulders about. Her voice rose thin and wailing like the sound of a peanut wagon.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You pay me tat fifteen dollar or I rent te room to somebody else."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'll pay you this very evening."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Vat time?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Six o'clock."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But I cant do that. Suppose I was late?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Tat's vy I vant te key. I'm trough vit vaiting."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right take the key. . . . . I hope you understand that after this insulting behavior it will be impossible for me to remain longer under your roof."</said></p>

                    <p>Mrs. Budkowitz laughed hoarsely. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Allright ven you pay me fifteen dollar you can take avay your grip."</said> He put the two keys tied together with string into her gray hand and slammed the door and strode down the street.</p>

                    <p>At the corner of Third Avenue he stopped and stood shivering in the hot afternoon sunlight, sweat running down behind his ears. He was too weak to swear. Jagged oblongs of harsh sound broke one after another over his head as an elevated past over. Trucks grated by along the avenue raising a dust that smelled of gasoline and trampled horsedung. The dead air stank of stores and lunchrooms. He began walking slowly uptown towards Fourteenth Street. At a corner a crinkly warm smell of cigars stopped him like a hand on his shoulder. He stood a while looking in the little shop watching the slim stained fingers of the cigarroller shuffle the brittle outside leaves of tobacco. Remembering Romeo and Juliet Arguelles Morales he sniffed deeply. The slick tearing of tinfoil, the careful slipping off of the band, the tiny ivory penknife for the end that slit delicately as flesh, the smell of the wax match, the long inhaling of bitter crinkled deep sweet smoke. And now sir about this little matter of the new Northern Pacific bond issue. . . . He clenched his fists in the clammy pockets of his raincoat. Take my key would she the old harridan? I'll show her, damn it. Joe Harland may be down and out but he's got his pride yet.</p>

                    <p>He walked west along Fourteenth and without stopping to think and lose his nerve went down into a small basement stationery store, strode through unsteadily to the back, and stood swaying in the doorway of a little office where sat at a rolltop desk a blueeyed baldheaded fat man.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello Felsius,"</said> croaked Harland.</p>

                    <p>The fat man got to his feet bewildered. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"God it aint Mr. Harland is it?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Joe Harland himself Felsius . . . er somewhat the worse for wear."</said> A titter died in his throat.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I'll be . . . Sit right down Mr. Harland."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Thank you Felsius. . . . Felsius I'm down and out."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It must be five years since I've seen you Mr, Harland."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"A rotten five years it's been for me. . . . I suppose its all luck. My luck wont ever change on this earth again. Remember when I'd come in from romping with the bulls and raise hell round the office? A pretty good bonus I gave the office force that Christmas."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Indeed it was Mr. Harland."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Must be a dull life storekeeping after the Street."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"More to my taste Mr. Harland, nobody to boss me here."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"And how's the wife and kids?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Fine, fine; the oldest boy's just out of highschool."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"That the one you named for me?"</said></p>

                    <p>Felsius nodded. His fingers fat as sausages were tapping uneasily on the edge of the desk.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I remember I thought I'd do something for that kid someday. It's a funny world."</said> Harland laughed feebly. He felt a shuddery blackness stealing up behind his head. He clenched his hands round his knee and contracted the muscles of his arms. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You see Felsius, it's this way. . . . I find myself for the moment in a rather embarrassing situation financially. . . . You know how those things are."</said> Felsius was staring straight ahead of him into the desk. Beads of sweat were starting out of his bald head. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"We all have our spell of bad luck dont we? I want to float a very small loan for a few days, just a few dollars, say twentyfive until certain combinations. . ."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Mr. Harland I cant do it."</said> Felsius got to his feet. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm sorry but principles is principles. . . . I've never borrowed or lent a cent in my life. I'm sure you understand that. . . ."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right, dont say any more."</said> Harland got meekly to his feet. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Let me have a quarter. . . . I'm not so young as I was and I haven't eaten for two days,"</said> he mumbled, looking down at his cracked shoes. He put out his hand to steady himself by the desk.</p>

                    <p>Felsius moved back against the wall as if to ward off a blow. He held out a fiftycent piece on thick trembling fingers. Harland took it, turned without a word and stumbled out through the shop. Felsius pulled a violet bordered handkerchief out of his pocket, mopped his brow and turned to his letters again.</p>

                    <p>She let the lashes fall over her eyes <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Allwight Morris,"</said> she whispered without looking at him. She put her hand a little tremulously through his arm.</p>

                    <p>At Columbus Circle they went into a drugstore. Girls in green, violet, pink summer dresses, young men in straw hats were three deep along the sodafountain. She stood back and admiringly watched him shove his way through. A man was leaning across the table behind her talking to a girl; their faces were hidden by their hatbrims.</p>

She sucked with pouting lips at a spoonful of icecream.  <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Ou Morris it's delicious."</said></p>

                    <p>The path between round splashes of arclights ducked into darkness. Through slant lights and nudging shadows came a smell of dusty leaves and trampled grass and occasionally a rift of cool fragrance from damp earth under shrubberies.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh I love it in the Park,"</said> chanted 
                        <person key="CassandraWilkins">

                    <p>Morris said nothing. He put his arm round her and held her tight to him so that his thigh rubbed against hers as they walked. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well Pierpont Morgan is dead. . . . I wish he'd left me a couple of million."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh Morris wouldn't it be wonderful? Where'd we live? On Central Park South."</said> They stood looking back at the glow of electric signs that came from Columbus Circle. To the left they could see curtained lights in the windows of a whitefaced apartmenthouse. He looked stealthily to the right and left and then kissed her. She twisted her mouth out from under his.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Dont. . . . Somebody might see us,"</said> she whispered breathless. Inside something like a dynamo was whirring, whirring. "Morris I've been saving it up to tell you. I think Goldweiser's going to give me a specialty bit in his next show. He's stagemanager of the second woad company and he's got a lot of pull up at the office. He saw me dance yesterday."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What did he say?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"He said he'd fix it up for me to see the big boss Monday. . . . Oh but Morris it's not the sort of thing I want to do, it's so vulgar and howid. . . . I want to do such beautiful things.

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"That's the trouble with you, you'll never make good, you're too upstage."</said> She looked up at him with streaming eyes that glistened in the white powdery light of an arclamp.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh don't cry for God's sake. I didnt mean anythin."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm not upstage with you Morris, am I?"</said> She sniffed and wiped her eyes.</p>

                    </person> life aint all beer an sourkraut."</said> As they walked tightly pressed one to another they felt rock under their feet. They were on a little hill of granite outcrop with shrubbery all round. The lights from the buildings that hemmed in the end of the Park shone in their faces. They stood apart holding each other's hands.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Take that redhaired girl up at 105th Street. . . . I bet she wouldnt be upstage when she was alone with a feller."</said></p>

                    <p>He pulled her to him roughly, pressed her to him hard with his spread hands on her back. She felt her legs tremble and go weak. She was falling through colored shafts of faintness. His mouth wouldnt let her catch her breath.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look out,"</said> he whispered pulling himself away from her. They walked on unsteadily down the path through the shrubbery. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I guess it aint."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh I hate you when you talk that way. . . . Weal love is all pure and lovely. . . . Morris you don't love me."</said></p>

                    <p>They sat down on a bench in the light. Behind them automobiles slithered with a constant hissing scuttle in two streams along the roadway. She put her hand on his knee and he covered it with his big stubby hand.</p></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Morris I feel that we are going to be very happy from now on, I feel it. You're going to get a fine job, I'm sure you are."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I want money. Once you got money you can do what you like."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But Morris dont you believe that you can do anything if you just want to hard enough? I believe that."</said> He edged his free arm round her waist. Gradually she let her head fall on his shoulder. "Oh I dont care," she whispered with dry lips. Behind them limousines, roadsters, touringcars, sedans, slithered along the roadway with snaky glint of lights running in two smooth continuous streams.</p>

                    <p>The brown serge smelled of mothballs as she folded it. She stooped to lay it in the trunk; a layer of tissuepaper below rustled when she smoothed the wrinkles with her hand. The first violet morning light outside the window was making the electriclight bulb grow red like a sleepless eye. Ellen straightened herself suddenly and stood stiff with her arms at her sides, her face flushed pink. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's just too low,"</said> she said. She spread a towel over the dresses and piled brushes, a handmirror, slippers, chemises, boxes of powder in pellmell on top of them. Then she slammed down the lid of the trunk, locked it and put the key in her flat alligatorskin purse. She stood looking dazedly about the room sucking a broken fingernail. Yellow sunlight was obliquely drenching the chimneypots and cornices of the houses across the street. She found herself staring at the white E.T.O. at the end of her trunk. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's all too terribly disgustingly low,"</said> she said again. Then she grabbed a nailfile off the bureau and scratched out the O. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Whee,"</said> she whispered and snapped her fingers. After she had put on a little bucketshaped black hat and a veil, so that people wouldn't see she'd been crying, she piled a lot of books, Youth's Encounter, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, The Golden Ass, Imaginary Conversations, Aphrodite, Chansons de Bilitis and the Oxford Book of French Verse in a silk shawl and tied them together.</p>



                    <p>There was a faint tapping at the door. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Who's that,"</said> she whispered.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It just me,"</said> came a tearful voice.</p>

He said be couldnt go on unless he had me weally, you know what he meant, and I said our love was so beautiful it could go on for years and years. I could love him for a lifetime without even kissing him. Dont you think love should be pure? And then he made fun of my dancing and said I was Chalif's mistwess and just kidding him along and we quaweled dwead fully and he called me dweadful names and went away and said he'd never come back."</said></p>

                    <p>She found the taxidriver in the hall looking at the names above the pushbuttons. He went up to fetch her trunk. She settled herself happily on the dusty buff seat of the taxi, taking deep breaths of the riversmelling morning air. The taxidriver smiled roundly at her when he had let the trunk slide off his back onto the dashboard.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Pretty heavy, miss."</said></p>

                    <p>When he leaned to crank the car the man pushed his hat back on his head letting ruddy curly hair out over his eyes. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right I'll take you anywhere you like,"</said> he said as he hopped into his seat in the jiggling car. When they turned down into the very empty sunlight of Broadway a feeling of happiness began to sizzle and soar like rockets inside her. The air beat fresh, thrilling in her face. The taxidriver talked back at her through the open window.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I thought yous was catchin a train to go away somewhere, miss."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I am going away somewhere."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm going away from my husband."</said> The words popped out of her mouth before she could stop them.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Did he trow you out?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"No I cant say he did that,"</said> she said laughing.</p>

                    <p>Fifth Avenue was white and empty and swept by a sparkling wind. The trees in Madison Square were unexpectedly bright green like ferns in a dun room. At the Brevoort a sleepy French nightporter carried her baggage. In the low whitepainted room the sunlight drowsed on a faded crimson armchair. Ellen ran about the room like a small child kicking her heels and clapping her hands. With pursed lips and tilted head she arranged her toilet things on the bureau. Then she hung her yellow nightgown on a chair and undressed, caught sight of herself in the mirror, stood naked looking at herself with her hands on her tiny firm appleshaped breasts.</p>

                    <p>She pulled on her nightgown and went to the phone. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Please send up a pot of chocolate and rolls to 108 . . . as soon as you can please."</said> Then she got into bed. She lay laughing with her legs stretched wide in the cool slippery sheets.</p>

                    <p>Hairpins were sticking into her head. She sat up and pulled them all out and shook the heavy coil of her hair down about her shoulders. She drew her knees up to her chin and sat thinking. From the street she could hear the occasional rumble of a truck. In the kitchens below her room a sound of clattering had begun. From all around came a growing rumble of traffic beginning. She felt hungry and alone. The bed was a raft on which she was marooned alone, always alone, afloat on a growling ocean. A shudder went down her spine. She drew her knees up closer to her chin.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"A fine specimen of a public-spirited citizen you are Hartly."</said</p>

                    <p>Hartly laughed and rubbed the palm of his hand over his bald head. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">>"Oh that stuff's all right in winter, but I cant go it in summer. . . . Hell all I live for is three weeks' vacation anyway. What do I care if all the architects in New York get bumped off as long as it dont raise the price of commutation to New Rochelle. . . . Let's go eat."</said> As they went down in the elevator Phil went on talking: <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"The only other man I ever knew who was really a born in the bone architect was ole Specker, the feller I worked for when I first came north, a fine old Dane he was too. Poor devil died o cancer two years ago. Man, he was an architect. I got a set of plans and specifications home for what he called a communal building. . . . Seventyfive stories high stepped back in terraces with a sort of hanging garden on every floor, hotels, theaters, Turkish baths, swimming pools, department stores, heating plant, refrigerating and market space all in the same buildin."</said></p>

                    <p>They were walking east along Thirtyfourth Street, sparse of people in the sultry midday. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gad,"</said> burst out Phil Sandbourne, suddenly. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"The girls in this town get prettier every year."</said>" "Like these new fashions, do you?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sure. All I wish is that I was gettin younger every year instead of older."</said></p>

                    <p>As they crossed Fifth Avenue Phil caught sight of a girl in a taxicab. From under the black brim of a little hat with a red cockade in it two gray eyes flash green black into his. He swallowed his breath. The traffic roars dwindled into distance. She shant take her eyes away. Two steps and open the door and sit beside her, beside her slenderness perched like a bird on the seat. Driver drive to beat hell. Her lips are pouting towards him, her eyes flutter gray caught birds. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hay look out. . ."</said> A pouncing iron rumble crashes down on him from behind. Fifth Avenue spins in red blue purple spirals. O Kerist. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"That's all right, let me be. I'll get up myself in a minute."</said> <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Move along there. Git back there."</said> Braying voices, blue pillars of policemen. His back, his legs are all warm gummy with blood. Fifth Avenue throbs with loudening pain. A little bell jingle-jangling nearer. As they lift hi minto the ambulance Fifth Avenue shrieks to throttling agony and bursts. He cranes his neck to see her, weakly, like a terrapin on its back; didnt my eyes snap steel traps on her? He finds himself whimpering. She might have stayed to see if I was killed. The jingle jangling bell dwindles fainter, fainter into the night.</p>

                    <p>The burglaralarm across the street had rung on steadily.

                    <p>Joe Harland had slumped down in his chair until his head rested on his arms. Between his grimestiff hands his eyes followed uneasily the lines in the marbletop table. The gutted lunchroom was silent under the sparse glower of two bulbs hanging over the counter where remained a few pies under a bellglass, and a man in a white coat nodding on a tall stool. Now and then the eyes in his gray doughy face flicked open and he grunted and looked about. At the last table over were the hunched shoulders of men asleep, faces crumpled like old newspapers pillowed on arms. Joe Harland sat up straight and yawned. A woman blobby under a raincoat with a face red and purplish streaked like rancid meat was asking for a cup of coffee at the counter. Carrying the mug carefully between her two hands she brought it over to the table and sat down opposite him. Joe Harland let his head down onto his arms again.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hay yous how about a little soivice?"</said> The woman's voice shrilled in Harland's ears like the screech of chalk on a blackboard.</p>

                    <p>Harland could smell her whiskey breath as she sobbed. He raised his head and stared at her. She twisted her flabby mouth into a smile and bobbed her head towards him.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Mister I aint accustomed to bein treated brutal. If my husband was aloive he wouldn't have the noive.

                    <p>Some strands of gray hair with traces of henna at the tips had fallen down about her face. The man in the white coat walked over to the table.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look here Mother McCree I'll trow ye out o here if you raise any more distoirbance. . . . What do you want?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"A nickel's woirt o doughnuts,"</said> she sniveled with a sidelong leer at Harland.</p>

                    <p>Joe Harland shoved his face into the hollow of his arm again and tried to go to sleep. He heard the plate set down followed by her toothless nibbling and an occasional sucking noise when she drank the coffee. A new customer had come in and was talking across the counter in a low growling voice.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Mister, mister aint it terrible to want a drink?"</said> He raised his head again and found her eyes the blurred blue of watered milk looking into his. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What ye goin to do now darlin?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"God knows."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh hell I want to sleep."</said></p>

                    <p>Her voice went on in a faint monotonous screech setting his teeth on edge. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"The Saints has been agin me ever since I lost my husband on the General Slocum. I aint been an honest woman."</said> . . . She began to sob again. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"The Virgin and Saints an Martyrs is agin me, everybody's agin me. . . . Oh wont somebody treat me noice."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I want to sleep. . . . Cant you shut up?"</said></p>

                    <p>She stooped and fumbled for her hat on the floor. She sat sobbing rubbing her swollen redgrimed knuckles into her eyes.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh mister dont ye want to treat me noice?"</said></p>

                    <p>Joe Harland got to his feet breathing hard. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Goddam you cant you shut up?"</said> His voice broke into a whine. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Isnt there anywhere you can get a little peace? There's nowhere you can get any peace."</said> He pulled his cap over his eyes, shoved his hands down into his pockets and shambled out of the lunchroom. Over Chatham Square the sky was brightening redviolet through the latticework of elevated tracks. The lights were two rows of bright brass knobs up the empty Bowery.</p>

                    <p>A policeman passed swinging his nightstick. Joe Harland felt the policeman's eyes on him. He tried to walk fast and briskly as if he were going somewhere on business.</p>

                    <p>Ellen sits in a gown of nilegreen silk in a springy armchair at the end of a long room jingling with talk and twinkle of chandeliers and jewelry, dotted with the bright moving black of evening clothes and silveredged colors of women's dresses. The curve of Harry Goldweiser's nose merges directly into the curve of his bald forehead, his big rump bulges over the edges of a triangular gilt stool, his small brown eyes measure her face like antennae as he talks to her. A woman nearby smells of sandalwood. A woman with orange lips and a chalk face under an orange turban passes talking to a man with a pointed beard. A hawk-beaked woman with crimson hair puts her hand on a man's shoulder from behind. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Why how do you do, Miss Cruikshank; it's surprising isn't it how everybody in the world is always at the same place at the same time." Ellen sits in the armchair drowsily listening, coolness of powder on her face and arms, fatness of rouge on her lips, her body just bathed fresh as a violet under the silk dress, under the silk underclothes; she sits dreamily, drowsily listening. A sudden twinge of men's voices knotting about her. She sits up cold white out of reach like a lighthouse. Men's hands crawl like bugs on the unbreakable glass. Men's looks blunder and flutter against it helpless as moths. But in deep pitblackness inside something clangs like a fire engine.</p>

                    <p>George Baldwin stood beside the breakfast table with a copy of the New York Times folded in his hand.<said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Now Cecily,"</said> he was saying <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"we must be sensible about these things."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Cant you see that I'm trying to be sensible?"</said> she said in a jerking snivelly voice. He stood looking at her without sitting down rolling a corner of the paper between his finger and thumb. Mrs. Baldwin was a tall woman with a mass of carefully curled chestnut hair piled on top of her head. She sat before the silver coffeeservice fingering the sugarbowl with mushroomwhite fingers that had very sharp pink nails.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"George I cant stand it any more that's all."</said> She pressed her quaking lips hard together.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But my dear you exaggerate. . . ."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"How exaggerate? . . . It means our life has been a pack of lies."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But Cecily we're fond of each other."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You married me for my social position, you know it. . . . I was fool enough to fall in love with you. All right, It's over."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's not true. I really loved you. Dont you remember how terrible you thought it was you couldnt really love me?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You brute to refer to that. . . . Oh it's horrible!"</said></p>

                    <p>The maid came in from the pantry with bacon and eggs on a tray. They sat silent looking at each other. The maid swished out of the room and closed the door. Mrs. Baldwin put her forehead down on the edge of the table and began to cry. Baldwin sat staring at the headlines in the paper. Assassination of Archduke Will Have Grave Consequences. Austrian Army Mobilized. He went over and put his hand on her crisp hair.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Poor old Cecily,"</said> he said.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Dont touch me."</said></p>

                    <p>She ran out of the room with her handkerchief to her face. He sat down, helped himself to bacon and eggs and toast and began to eat; everything tasted like paper. He stopped eating to scribble a note on a scratchpad he kept in his breast pocket behind his handkerchief: See Collins vs. Arbuthnot, N.Y.S.C. Appel. Div.</p>

                    <p>The sound of a step in the hall outside caught his ear, the click of a latch. The elevator had just gone down. He ran four flights down the steps. Through the glass and wroughtiron doors of the vestibule downstairs he caught sight of her on the curb, standing tall and stiff, pulling on her gloves. He rushed out and took her by the hand just as a taxi drove up. Sweat beaded on his forehead and was prickly under his collar. He could see himself standing there with the napkin ridiculous in his hand and the colored doorman grinning and saying, "Good mornin, Mr. Baldwin, looks like it going to be a fine day." Gripping her hand tight, he said in a low voice through his teeth:</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Cecily there's something I want to talk to you about. Wont you wait a minute and we'll go downtown together? . . . Wait about five minutes please,"</said> he said to the taxi-driver. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"We'll be right down."</said> Squeezing her wrist hard he walked back with her to the elevator. When they stood in the hall of their own apartment, she suddenly looked him straight in the face with dry blazing eyes.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Come in here Cecily"</said> he said gently. He closed their bedroom door and locked it. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Now lets talk this over quietly. Sit down dear."</said> He put a chair behind her. She sat down suddenly stiffly like a marionette.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Now look here Cecily you have no right to talk the way you do about my friends. Mrs. Oglethorpe is a friend of mine. We occasionally take tea together in some perfectly public place and that's all. I would invite her up here but I've been afraid you would be rude to her. . . . You cant go on giving away to your insane jealousy like this. I allow you complete liberty and trust you absolutely. I think I have the right to expect the same confidence from you. . . . Cecily do be my sensible little girl again. You've been listening to what a lot of old hags fabricate out of whole cloth maliciously to make you miserable."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"She's not the only one."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Cecily I admit frankly there were times soon after we were married . . . when . . . But that's all over years ago. . . . And who's fault was it? . . . Oh Cecily a woman like you cant understand the physical urgences of a man like me."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Havent I done my best?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"My dear these things arent anybody's fault. . . . I dont blame you. . . . If you'd really loved me then . . ."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What do you think I stay in this hell for except for you? Oh you're such a brute."</said> She sat dryeyed staring at her feet in their gray buckskin slippers, twisting and untwisting in her fingers the wet string of her handkerchief.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look here Cecily a divorce would be very harmful to my situation downtown just at the moment, but if you really dont want to go on living with me I'll see what I can arrange. . . . But in any event you must have more confidence in me. You know I'm fond of you. And for God's sake dont go to see anybody about it without consulting me. You dont want a scandal and headlines in the papers, do you?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right . . . leave me alone. . . . I dont care about anything."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right. . . . I'm pretty late. I'll go on downtown in that taxi. You don't want to come shopping or anything?"</said></p>

                    <p>She shook her head. He kissed her on the forehead, took his straw hat and stick in the hall and hurried out.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh I'm the most miserable woman,"</said> she groaned and got to her feet. Her head ached as if it were bound with hot wire. She went to the window and leaned out into the sunlight. Across Park Avenue the flameblue sky was barred with the red girder cage of a new building. Steam riveters rattled incessantly; now and then a donkeyengine whistled and there was a jingle of chains and a fresh girder soared crosswise in the air. Men in blue overalls moved about the scaffolding. Beyond to the northwest a shining head of clouds soared blooming compactly like a cauliflower. Oh if it would only rain. As the thought came to her there was a low growl of thunder above the din of building and of traffic. Oh if it would only rain.</p>



                    <p>Ellen had just hung a chintz curtain in the window to hide with its blotchy pattern of red and purple flowers the vista of desert backyards and brick flanks of downtown houses. In the middle of the bare room was a boxcouch cumbered with teacups, a copper chafingdish and percolator; the yellow hardwood floor was littered with snippings of chintz and curtainpins; books, dresses, bedlinen cascaded from a trunk in the corner; from a new mop in the fireplace exuded a smell of cedar oil. Ellen was leaning against the wall in a daffodilcolored kimono looking happily about the big shoebox-shaped room when the buzzer startled her. She pushed a rope of hair up off her forehead and pressed the button that worked the latch. There was a little knock on the door. A woman was standing in the dark of the hall.</p>

                    <p>Joe Harland, puffing on his pipe, pulled to and bolted the wide quaking board gates. A last splash of garnetcolored sunlight was fading on the tall housewall across the excavation. Blue arms of cranes stood out dark against it. Harland's pipe had gone out, he stood puffing at it with his back to the gate looking at the files of empty wheelbarrows, the piles of picks and shovels, the little shed for the donkey-engine and the steam drills that sat perched on a split rock like a mountaineer's shack. It seemed to him peaceful in spite of the rasp of traffic from the street that seeped through the hoarding. He went into the leanto by the gate where the telephone was, sat down in the chair, knocked out, filled and lit his pipe and spread the newspaper out on his knees. Contractors Plan Lockout to Answer Builders' Strike. He yawned and threw back his head. The light was too blue-dim to read. He sat a long time staring at the stub scarred toes of his boots. His mind was a fuzzy comfortable blank. Suddenly he saw himself in a dress-suit wearing a top hat with an orchid in his buttonhole. The Wizard of Wall Street looked at the lined red face and the gray hair under the mangy cap and the big hands with their grimy swollen knuckles and faded with a snicker. He remembered faintly the smell of a Corona-Corona as he reached into the pocket of the peajacket for a can of Prince Albert to refill his pipe. "What dif does it make I'd like to know?" he said aloud. When he lit a match the night went suddenly inky all round. He blew out the match. His pipe was a tiny genial red volcano that made a discreet cluck each time he pulled on it. He smoked very slowly inhaling deep. The tall buildings all round were haloed with ruddy glare from streets and electriclight signs. Looking straight up through glimmering veils of reflected light he could see the blueblack sky and stars. The tobacco was sweet. He was very happy.</p>

                    <p>A glowing cigarend crossed the door of the shack. Harland grabbed his lantern and went out. He held the lantern up in the face of a blond young man with a thick nose and lips and a cigar in the side of his mouth.</p>

                    <p>Joe Harland drew a little water from a tin container, settled himself in his chair and stretched his arms out and yawned. Eleven o'clock. They would just be getting out of the theaters, men in eveningclothes, girls in lowneck dresses; men were going home to their wives and mistresses; the city was going to bed. Taxis honked and rasped outside the hoarding, the sky shimmered with gold powder from electric signs. He dropped the butt of the cigar and crushed it on the floor with his heel. He shuddered and got to his feet, then paced slowly round the edge of the buildinglot swinging his lantern.</p>

                    <p>The light from the street yellowed faintly a big sign on which was a picture of a skyscraper, white with black windows against blue sky and white clouds.

When he had turned out the light he sat a long while on the edge of the bed. The faraway sounds of sirens from the river gave him gooseflesh. From the street he heard footsteps, the sound of men and women's voices, low youthful laughs of people going home two by two. A phonograph was playing Secondhand Rose. He lay on his back on top of the sheet. There came on the air through the window a sourness of garbage, a smell of burnt gasoline and traffic and dusty pavements, a huddled stuffiness of pigeonhole rooms where men and women's bodies writhed alone tortured by the night and the young summer. He lay with seared eyeballs staring at the ceiling, his body glowed in a brittle shivering agony like redhot metal.</p>

                        </person> went to the window and looked down the fire escape into the alley. Oglethorpe had gone. It was raining hard. A smell of wet bricks rose from the housewalls.</p>

                    <p>He closed the door sharply in her face and locked it. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"The goddam fools they act like crazy people,"</said> he said through his teeth. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What the hell do they think this is?"</said></p>

                    <p>His hands were cold and trembling. He pulled a blanket up over him. He lay listening to the steady beat of the rain and the hissing spatter of a gutter. Now and then a puff of wind blew a faint cool spray in his face. There still lingered in the room a frail cedarwood gruff smell of her heavycoiled hair, a silkiness of her body where she had crouched wrapped in the sheet hiding.</p>



                    <p>Ed Thatcher sat in his bay window among the Sunday papers. His hair was grizzled and there were deep folds in his cheeks. The upper buttons of his pongee trousers were undone to ease his sudden little potbelly. He sat in the open window looking out over the blistering asphalt at the endless stream of automobiles that whirred in either direction past the yellowbrick row of stores and the redbrick station under the eaves of which on a black ground gold letters glinted feebly in the sun: Passaic. Apartments round about emitted a querulous Sunday grinding of phonographs playing It's a Bear. The Sextette from Lucia, selections from The Quaker Girl. On his knees lay the theatrical section of the New York Times. He looked out with bleared eyes into the quivering heat feeling his ribs tighten with a breathless ache. He had just read a paragraph in a marked copy of Town Topics.</p>

                    <p>Malicious tongues are set wagging by the undeniable fact that young Stanwood Emery's car is seen standing every night outside the Knickerbocker Theatre and never does it leave they say, without a certain charming young actress whose career is fast approaching stellar magnitude. This same young gentleman, whose father is the head of one of the city's most respected lawfirms, who recently left Harvard under slightly unfortunate circumstances, has been astonishing the natives for some time with his exploits which we are sure are merely the result of the ebullience of boyish spirits. A word to the wise.</p>

                    <p>The bell rang three times. Ed Thatcher dropped his papers and hurried quaking to the door. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Ellie you're so late. I was afraid you weren't coming."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Daddy dont I always come when I say I will?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Of course you do deary."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"How are you getting on? How's everything at the office?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Mr. Elbert's on his vacation. . . . I guess I'll go when he comes back. I wish you'd come down to Spring Lake with me for a few days. It'd do you good."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But daddy I cant."</said> . . . She pulled off her hat and dropped it on the davenport. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look I brought you some roses, daddy."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Think of it; they're red roses like your mother used to like. That was very thoughtful of you I must say. . . . But I dont like going all alone on my vacation."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh you'll meet lots of cronies daddy, sure you will."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why couldnt you come just for a week?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"In the first place I've got to look for a job . . . show's going on the road and I'm not going just at present. Harry Goldweiser's awfully sore about it."</said> Thatcher sat down in the bay window again and began piling up the Sunday papers on a chair. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why daddy what on earth are you doing with that copy of Town Topics?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh nothing. I'd never read it; I just bought it to see what it was like."</said> He flushed and compressed his lips as he shoved it in among the Times.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's just a blackmail sheet."</said> Ellen was walking about the room. She had put the roses in a vase. A spiced coolness was spreading from them through the dustheavy air. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Daddy, there's something I want to tell you about . . . Jojo and I are going to get divorced."</said> Ed Thatcher sat with his hands on his knees nodding with tight lips, saying nothing. His face was gray and dark, almost the speckled gray of his pongee suit. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's nothing to take on about. We've just decided we cant get along together. It's all going through quietly in the most approved style . . . George Baldwin, who's a friend of mine, is going to run it through."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"He with Emery and Emery?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Yes."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hum."</said></p>

                    <p>They were silent. Ellen leaned over to breathe deep of the roses. She watched a little green measuring worm cross a bronzed leaf.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Honestly I'm terribly fond of Jojo, but it drives me wild to live with him. . . . I owe him a whole lot, I know that."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I wish you'd never set eyes on him."</said></p>

                    <p>Thatcher cleared his throat and turned his face away from her to look out the window at the two endless bands of automobiles that passed along the road in front of the station. Dust rose from them and angular glitter of glass enamel and nickel. Tires made a swish on the oily macadam. Ellen dropped onto the davenport and let her eyes wander among the faded red roses of the carpet.</p>

                    <p>The bell rang. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'll go daddy. . . . How do you do Mrs. Culveteer?"</said></said></p>

                    <p>A redfaced broad woman in a black and white chiffon dress came into the room puffing. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh you must forgive my butting in, I'm just dropping by for a second. . . . How are you Mr. Thatcher? . . . You know my dear your poor father has really been very poorly."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Nonsense; all I had was a little backache."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Lumbago my dear."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why daddy you ought to have let me know."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"The sermon today was most inspiring, Mr. Thatcher. . . . Mr. Lourton was at his very best."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I guess I ought to rout out and go to church now and then, but you see I like to lay round the house Sundays."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Of course Mr, Thatcher it's the only day you have. My husband was just like that. . . . But I think it's different with Mr. Lourton than with most clergymen. He has such an uptodate commonsense view of things. It's really more like attending an intensely interesting lecture than going to church. . . . You understand what I mean."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Y'll tell you what I'll do Mrs. Culveteer, next Sunday if it's not too hot I'll go. . . . I guess I'm getting too set in my ways."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh a little change does us all good. . . . Mrs. Oglethorpe you have no idea how closely we follow your career, in the Sunday papers and all. . . . I think it's simply wonderful. . . . As I was telling Mr. Thatcher only yesterday it must take a lot of strength of character and deep Christian living to withstand the temptations of stage life nowadays. It's inspiring to think of a young girl and wife coming so sweet and unspoiled through all that."</said></p>

                    <p>Ellen kept looking at the floor so as not to catch her father's eye. He was tapping with two fingers on the arm of his morrischair. Mrs. Culveteer beamed from the middle of the davenport. She got to her feet. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I just must run along. We have a green girl in the kitchen and I'm sure dinner's all ruined. . . Wont you drop in this afternoon . . .? quite informally. I made some cookies and we'll have some gingerale out just in case somebody turns up."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm sure we'd be delighted Mrs. Culveteer,"</said> said Thatcher getting stiffly to his feet. Mrs. Culveteer in her bunchy dress waddled out the door.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well Ellie suppose we go eat. . . . She's a very nice kindhearted woman. She's always bringing me pots of jam and marmalade. She lives upstairs with her sister's family. She's the widow of a traveling man."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"That was quite a line about the temptations of stage life,"</said> said Ellen with a little laugh in her throat. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Come along or the place'll be crowded. Avoid the rush is my motto."</said></p>

                    <p>Said Thatcher in a peevish crackling voice, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Let's not dawdle around."</said></p>

                    <p>Ellen spread out her sunshade as they stepped out of the door flanked on either side by bells and letterboxes. A blast of gray heat beat in their faces. They passed the stationery store, the red A. and P., the corner drugstore from which a stale coolness of sodawater and icecream freezers drifted out under the green awning, crossed the street, where their feet sank into the sticky melting asphalt, and stopped at the Sagamore Cafeteria. It was twelve exactly by the clock in the window that had round its face in old English lettering, Time to Eat. Under it was a large rusty fern and a card announcing Chicken Dinner $1.25. Ellen lingered in the doorway looking up the quivering street. "Look daddy we'll probably have a thunderstorm." A cumulus soared in unbelievable snowy contours in the slate sky. "Isnt that a fine cloud? Wouldnt it be fine if we had a riproaring thunderstorm?"</p>

                    <p>Ed Thatcher looked up, shook his head and went in through the swinging screen door. Ellen followed him. Inside it smelled of varnish and waitresses. They sat down at a table near the door under a droning electric fan.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"How do you do Mr. Thatcher? How you been all the week sir? How do you do miss?"</said> The bonyfaced peroxidehaired waitress hung over them amicably. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What'll it be today sir, roast Long Island duckling or roast Philadelphia milkfed capon?"</said></p>

                    <p>Such afternoons the buses are crowded into line like elephants in a circusparade. Morningside Heights to Washington Square, Penn Station to Grant's Tomb. Parlorsnakes and flappers joggle hugging downtown uptown, hug joggling gray square after gray square, until they see the new moon giggling over Weehawken and feel the gusty wind of a dead Sunday blowing dust in their faces, dust of a typsy twilight.</p>



                    <p>THEY are walking up the Mall in Central Park.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Looks like he had a boil on his neck,"</said> says Ellen in front of the statue of Burns.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Ah,"</said> whispers Harry Goldweiser with a fat-throated sigh, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"but he was a great poet."</said></p>

                    <p>She is walking in her wide hat in her pale loose dress that the wind now and then presses against her legs and arms, silkily, swishily walking in the middle of great rosy and purple and pistachiogreen bubbles of twilight that swell out of the grass and trees and ponds, bulge against the tall houses sharp gray as dead teeth round the southern end of the park, melt into the indigo zenith. When he talks, forming sentences roundly with his thick lips, continually measuring her face with his brown eyes, she feels his words press against her body, nudge in the hollows where her dress clings; she can hardly breathe for fear of listening to him.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"The Zinnia Girl's going to be an absolute knockout, Elaine, I'm telling you and that part's just written for you, I'd enjoy working with you again, honest. . . . You're so different, that's what it is about you. All these girls round New York here are just the same, they're monotonous. Of course you could sing swell if you wanted to. . . . I've been crazy as a loon since I met you, and that's a good six months now. I sit down to eat and the food dont have any taste. . . . You cant understand how lonely a man gets when year after year he's had to crush his feelings down into himself. When I was a young fellow I was different, but what are you to do? I had to make money and make my way in the world. And so I've gone on year after year. For the first time I'm glad I did it, that I shoved ahead and made big money, because now I can offer it all to you. Understand what I mean? . . . All those ideels and beautiful things pushed down into myself when I was making my way in a man's world were like planting seed and you're their flower."</said></p>

                    <p>Now and then as they walk the back of his hand brushes against hers; she clenches her fist sullenly drawing it away from the hot determined pudginess of his hand.</p>

                    <p>The Mall is full of couples, families waiting for the music to begin. It smells of children and dress-shields and talcum powder. A balloonman passes them trailing red and yellow and pink balloons like a great inverted bunch of grapes behind him. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh buy me a balloon."</said> The words are out of her mouth before she can stop them.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hay you gimme one of each color. . . . And how about one of those gold ones? No keep the change."</said></p>

                    <p>Ellen put the strings of the balloons into the dirtsticky hands of three little monkeyfaced girls in red tams. Each balloon caught a crescent of violet glare from the arclight.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Aw you like children, Elaine, dont you? I like a woman to like children."</said></p>

                    <p>Ellen sits numb at a table on the terrace of the Casino. A hot gust of foodsmell and the rhythm of a band playing He's a Ragpicker swirls chokingly about her; now and then she butters a scrap of roll and puts it in her mouth. She feels very helpless, caught like a fly in his sticky trickling sentences.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"There's nobody else in New York could have got me to walk that far, I'll tell you that. . . . I walked too much in the old days, do you understand, used to sell papers when I was a kid and run errands for Schwartz's Toystore . . . on my feet all day except when I was in nightschool. I thought I was going to be a lawyer, all us East Side fellers thought we were goin to be lawyers. Then I worked as an usher one summer at the Irving Place and got the theater bug. . . . Not such a bad hunch it turned out to be, but it's too uncertain. Now I dont care any more, only want to cover my losses. That's the trouble with me. I'm thirtyfive an I dont care any more. Ten years ago I was still only a kind of clerk in old man Erlanger's office, and now there's lots of em whose shoes I used to shine in the old days'd be real glad of the opportunity to sweep my floors on West Forty-eighth. . . . Tonight I can take you anywhere in New York, I dont care how expensive or how chic it is . . . an in the old days us kids used to think it was paradise if we had five plunks to take a couple of girls down to the Island. . . . I bet all that was different with you Elaine. . . . But what I want to do is get that old feelin back, understand? . . . Where shall we go?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why dont we go down to Coney Island then? I've never been?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's a pretty rough crowd . . . still we can just ride round. Let's do it. I'll go phone for the car."</said></p>

                    <p>Ellen sits alone looking down into her coffeecup. She puts a lump of sugar on her spoon, dips it in the coffee and pops it into her mouth where she crunches it slowly, rubbing the grains of sugar against the roof of her mouth with her tongue. The orchestra is playing a tango.</p>

                    <p>The sun streaming into the office under the drawn shades cut a bright slanting layer like watered silk through the cigarsmoke.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Mighty easy,"</said> George Baldwin was saying dragging out the words. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gus we got to go mighty easy on this."</said> Gus McNiel bullnecked redfaced with a heavy watchchain in his vest sat in the armchair nodding silently, pulling on his cigar. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"As things are now no court would sustain such an injunction . . . an injunction that seems to me a pure piece of party politics on Judge Connor's part, but there are certain elements. . . ."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You said it. . . . Look here George I'm goin to leave this whole blame thing to you. You pulled me through the East New York dockin space mess and I guess you can pull me through this."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But Gus your position in this whole affair has been entirely within the bounds of legality. If it werent I certainly should not be able to take the case, not even for an old friend like you."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You know me George. . . . I never went back on a guy yet and I dont expect to have anybody go back on me."</said> Gus got heavily to his feet and began to limp about the office leaning on a goldknobbed cane. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Connor's a son of a bitch . . . an honest, you wouldn't believe it but he was a decent guy before he went up to Albany."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"My position will be that your attitude in this whole matter has been willfully misconstrued. Connor has been using his position on the bench to further a political end."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"God I wish we could get him. Jez I thought he was one of the boys; he was until he went up an got mixed up with all those lousy upstate Republicans. Albany's been the ruination of many a good man."</said></p>

                    <p>Baldwin got up from the flat mahogany table where he sat between tall sheaves of foolscap and put his hand on Gus's shoulder. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Dont you lose any sleep over it. . . ."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'd feel all right if it wasn't for those Interborough bonds."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What bonds? Who's seen any bonds? . . . Let's get this young fellow in here . . . Joe . . . And one more thing Gus, for heaven's sakes keep your mouth shut. . . . If any reporters or anybody comes round to see you tell 'em about your trip to Bermuda. . . . We can get publicity enough when we need it. Just at present we want to keep the papers out of it or you'll have all the reformers on your heels."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well aint they friends of yours? You can fix it up with em."</said></p>



                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gus I'm a lawyer and not a politician. . . . I dont meddle in those things at all. They dont interest me."</said></p>

                    <p>Baldwin brought the flat of his hand down on a pushbell. An ivoryskinned young woman with heavy sullen eyes and jetty hair came into the room.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"How do you do Mr. McNeil."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"My but you're looking well Miss Levitsky."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Emily tell em to send that young fellow that's waiting for Mr. McNiel in."</said></p>

                    <p>Joe O'Keefe came in dragging his feet a little, with his straw hat in his hand. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Howde do sir."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look here Joe, what does McCarthy say?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Contractors and Builders Association's goin to declare a Jockout from Monday on."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"And how's the union?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"We got a full treasury. We're goin to fight."</said></p>

                    <p></p>Baldwin sat down on the edge of the desk. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I wish I knew what Mayor Mitchel's attitude was on all this."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"That reform gang's just treadin water like they always do,"</said> said Gus savagely biting the end off a cigar. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"When's this decision going to be made public?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Saturday."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well keep in touch with us."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right gentlemen. And please dont call me on the phone. It dont look exactly right. You see it aint my office."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Might be wiretappin goin on too. Those fellers wont stop at nothin. Well see ye later Joey."</said></p>

                    <p>Joe nodded and walked out. Baldwin turned frowning to Gus.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gus I dont know what I'm goin to do with you if you dont keep out of all this labor stuff. A born politician like you ought to have better sense. You just cant get away with it."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But we got the whole damn town lined up."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I know a whole lot of the town that isnt lined up. But thank Heavens that's not my business. This bond stuff is all right, but if you get into a mess with this strike business I couldn't handle your case. The firm wouldnt stand for it,"</said> he whispered fiercely. Then he said aloud in his usual voice, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well how's the wife, Gus?"</said></p>

                    <p>Outside in the shiny marble hall, Joe O'Keefe was whistling Sweet Rosy O'Grady waiting for the elevator. Imagine a guy havin a knockout like that for a secretary. He stopped whistling and let the breath out silently through pursed lips. In the elevator he greeted a walleyed man in a check suit. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hullo Buck."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Been on your vacation yet?"</said></p>

                    <p>Joe stood with his feet apart and his hands in his pockets. He shook his head. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I get off Saturday."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I guess I'll take in a couple o days at Atlantic City myself."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"How do you do it?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh the kid's clever."</said></p>

                    <p>Coming out of the building O'Keefe had to make his way through people crowding into the portal. A slate sky sagging between the tall buildings was spatting the pavements with fiftycent pieces. Men were running to cover with their straw hats under their coats. Two girls had made hoods of newspaper over their summer bonnets. He snatched blue of their eyes, a glint of lips and teeth as he passed. He walked fast to the corner and caught an uptown car on the run. The rain advanced down the street in a solid sheet glimmering, swishing, beating newspapers flat, prancing in silver nipples along the asphalt, striping windows, putting shine on the paint of streetcars and taxicabs. Above Fourteenth there was no rain, the air was sultry.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"A funny thing weather,"</said> said an old man next to him. O'Keefe grunted. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"When I was a boy onct I saw it rain on one side of the street an a house was struck by lightnin an on our side not a drop fell though the old man wanted it bad for some tomatoplants he'd just set out."</said></p>

                    <p>Crossing Twentythird O'Keefe caught sight of the tower of Madison Square Garden. He jumped off the car; the momentum carried him in little running steps to the curb. Turning his coatcollar down again he started across the square. On the end of a bench under a tree drowsed Joe Harland. O'Keefe plunked down in the seat beside him.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello Joe. Have a cigar."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello Joe. I'm glad to see you my boy. Thanks. It's many a day since I've smoked one of these things. . . . What are you up to? Aint this kind of out of your beat?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I felt kinder blue so I thought I'd buy me a ticket to the fight Saturday."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What's the matter?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hell I dunno. . . . Things dont seem to go right. Here I've got myself all in deep in this political game and there dont seem to be no future in it. God I wish I was educated like you."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"A lot of good it's done me."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I wouldn't say that. . . . If I could ever git on the track you were on I bet ye I wouldn't lose out."</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You cant tell Joe, funny things get into a man."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"There's women and that sort of stuff."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"No I dont mean that. . . . You get kinder disgusted."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But hell I dont see how a guy with enough jack can git disgusted."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Then maybe it was booze, I dont know."</said></p>

                    <p>They sat silent a minute. The afternoon was flushing with sunset. The cigarsmoke was blue and crinkly about their heads.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look at the swell dame. . . . Look at the way she walks. Aint she a peacherino? That's the way I like 'em, all slick an frilly with their lips made up. . . . Takes jack to go round with dames like that."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"They're no different from anybody else, Joe."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"The hell you say."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Say Joe you havent got an extra dollar on you?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Maybe I have."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"My stomach's a little out of order. . . . I'd like to take a little something to steady it, and I'm flat till I get paid Saturday . . . er . . . you understand . . . you're sure you dont mind? Give me your address and I'll send it to you first thing Monday morning."</said></p>



                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hell dont worry about it, I'll see yez around somewheres."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Thank you Joe. And for God's sake dont buy any more Blue Peter Mines on a margin without asking me about it. I may be a back number but I can still tell a goldbrick with my eyes closed."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I got my money back."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It took the devil's own luck to do it."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Jez it strikes me funny me loanin a dollar to the guy who owned half the Street."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh I never had as much as they said I did."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"This is a funny place. . . ."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Where?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh I dunno, I guess everywhere. . . . Well so long Joe, I guess I'll go along an buy that ticket. . . . Jez it's goin to be a swell fight."</said></p>

                    <p>Joe Harland watched the young man's short jerky stride as he went off down the path with his straw hat on the side of his head. Then he got to his feet and walked east along Twentythird Street, The pavements and housewalls still gave off heat although the sun had set. He stopped outside a corner saloon and examined carefully a group of stuffed ermines, gray with dust, that occupied the center of the window. Through the swinging doors a sound of quiet voices and a malty coolness seeped into the street. He suddenly flushed and bit his upper lip and after a furtive glance up and down the street went in through the swinging doors and shambled up to the brassy bottleglittering bar.</p>

                    <p>After the rain outdoors the plastery backstage smell was pungent in their nostrils. Ellen hung the wet raincoat on the back of the door and put her umbrella in a corner of the dressing room where a little puddle began to spread from it. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"And all I could think of,"</said> she was saying in a low voice to

                    <p>Sitting in front of the mirror at her dressingtable Ellen was wiping cold cream off her face with quick dabs of a little towel. From her makeup box a smell of greasepaint and cocoabutter melted fatly through the room.</p>

                    <p>The two women pushed him into the bathroom. He flopped limply into the tub, and lay there asleep with his feet in the air and his head on the faucets. Milly was making little rapid clucking noises with her tongue.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"He's like a sleepy baby when he's like this,"</said> whispered Ellen softly. She stuck the folded bathmat under his head and brushed the sweaty hair off his forehead. He was hardly breathing. She leaned and kissed his eyelids very softly.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Miss Elaine you must hurry . . . curtain's ringing up."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look quick am I all right?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Pretty as a picture. . . . Lord love you dear,"</said></p>

                    <p>Ellen ran down the stairs and round to the wings, stood there, panting with terror as if she had just missed being run over by an automobile grabbed the musicroll she had to go on with from the property man, got her cue and walked on into the glare.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"How do you do it Elaine?"</said> Harry Goldweiser was saying, shaking his calf's head from the chair behind her. She could see him in the mirror as she took her makeup off. A taller man with gray eyes and eyebrows stood beside him. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You remember when they first cast you for the part I said to Mr. Fallik, Sol she cant do it, didnt I Sol?"</said></p>



                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sure you did Harry."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I thought that no girl so young and beautiful could put, you know . . . put the passion and terror into it, do you understand? . . . Sol and I were out front for that scene in the last act."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Wonderful, wonderful,"</said> groaned Mr. Fallik. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Tell us how you do it Elaine."</said></p>

                    <p>The makeup came off black and pink on the cloth. Milly moved discreetly about the background hanging up dresses.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Do you know who it was who coached me up on that scene? John Oglethorpe. It's amazing the ideas he has about acting."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Yes it's a shame he's so lazy. . . . He'd be a very valuable actor."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's not exactly laziness . . ."</said> Ellen shook down her hair and twisted it in a coil in her two hands. She saw Harry Goldweiser nudge Mr. Fallik.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Beautiful isn't it?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"How's Red Red Rose going?"<</said>/p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh dont ask me Elaine. Played exclusively to the ushers last week, do you understand? I dont see why it dont go, it's catchy. . . . Mae Merrill has a pretty figure. Oh, the show business has all gone to hell."</said></p>

                    <p>Ellen put the last bronze pin in the copper coil of her hair. She tossed her chin up. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'd like to try something like that."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But one thing at a time my dear young lady; we've just barely got you started as an emotional actress."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I hate it; it's all false. Sometimes I want to run down to the foots and tell the audience, go home you damn fools. This is a rotten show and a lot of fake acting and you ought to know it. In a musical show you could be sincere."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Didnt I tell ye she was nuts Sol? Didnt I tell ye she was nuts?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'll use some of that little speech in my publicity next week. . . . I can work it in fine."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You cant have her crabbin the show."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"No but I can work it in in that column about aspirations of celebrities. . . . You know, this guy is President of the Zozodont Company and would rather have been a fireman and another would rather have been a keeper at the Zoo. . . . Great human interest stuff."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You can tell them Mr. Fallik that I think the woman's place is in the home . . . for the feebleminded."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Ha ha ha,"</said> laughed Harry Goldweiser showing the gold teeth in the sides of his mouth. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But I know you could dance and sing with the best of em, Elaine."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Wasnt I in the chorus for two years before I married Oglethorpe?"</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You must have started in the cradle,"</said> said Mr. Fallik leering under his gray lashes.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I must ask you gentlemen to get out of here a minute while I change. I'm all wringing wet every night after that last act."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"We got to get along anyway . . . do you understand? . . . Mind if I use your bathroom a sec?"</p>

                    <p>Milly stood in front of the bathroom door. Ellen caught the jetty glance of her eyes far apart in her blank white face. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm afraid you cant Harry, it's out of order."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'll go over to Charley's. . . . I'll tell Thompson to have a plumber come and look at it. . . . Well good night kid. Be good."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Good night Miss Oglethorpe,"</said> said Mr. Fallik creakily, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"and if you cant be good be careful."</said> Milly closed the door after them.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Whee, that's a relief,"</said> cried Ellen and stretched out her arms.</p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I tell you I was scared deary. . . . Dont you ever let any feller like that come to the theater with ye. I've seen many a good trouper ruined by things like that. I'm tellin ye because I'm fond of you Miss Elaine, an I'm old an I know about the showbusiness."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Of course you are Milly, and you're quite right too . . . Lets see if we can wake him up."</said></p>

                    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"My God Milly, look at that."</said></p>

Ellen leaned against the bathroom door laughing with her eyes full of tears.</p>

<p>Red light. Bell.</p>

<p>A block deep four ranks of cars wait at the grade crossing, fenders in taillights, mudguards scraping mudguards, motors purring hot, exhausts reeking, cars from Babylon and Jamaica, cars from Montauk, Port Jefferson, Patchogue, limousines from Long Beach, Far Rockaway, roadsters from Great Neck . . . cars full of asters and wet bathingsuits, sunsinged necks, mouths sticky from sodas and hotdawgs . . . cars dusted with pollen of ragweed and goldenrod.</p>

<p>Green light. Motors race, gears screech into first. The cars space out, flow in a long ribbon along the ghostly cement road, between blackwindowed blocks of concrete factories, between bright slabbed colors of signboards towards the glow over the city that stands up incredibly into the night sky like the glow of a great lit tent, like the yellow tall bulk of a tentshow.</p>



<p>Sarajevo, the word stuck in her throat when she tried to say it. . . .</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's terrible to think of, terrible,"</said> George Baldwin was groaning. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"The Street'll go plumb to hell. . . . They'll close the Stock Exchange, only thing to do."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"And I've never been to Europe either. . . .

The taxi made a half turn and stopped in front of a roadhouse that oozed pink light and ragtime through every chink.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Big crowd tonight,"</said> said the taximan to Baldwin when he paid him.</p>

<p>The red hallway smelt of lobster and steamed clams and cocktails.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why hello Gus! . . . Elaine let me introduce Mr. and Mrs. McNiel. . . . This is Miss Oglethorpe."</said> Ellen shook the big hand of a rednecked snubnosed man and the small precisely gloved hand of his wife. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gus I'll see you before we go. . . ."</said></p>

<p>Ellen was following the headwaiter's swallowtails along the edge of the dancefloor. They sat at a table beside the wall. The music was playing Everybody's Doing It. Baldwin hummed it as he hung over her a second arranging the wrap on the back of her chair.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Elaine you are the loveliest person . . ."</said> he began as he sat down opposite her. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It seems so horrible. I dont see how it's possible."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"This war. I cant think of anything else."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I can . . ." She kept her eyes on the menu. "Did you notice those two people I introduced to you?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Yes. Is that the McNiel whose name is in the paper all the time? Some row about a builders' strike and the Interborough bond issue."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's all politics. I bet he's glad of the war, poor old Gus. It'll do one thing, it'll keep that row off the front page. . . . I'll tell you about him in a minute. . . . I dont suppose you like steamed clams do you? They are very good here."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"George I adore steamed clams."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Then we'll have a regular old fashioned Long Island shore dinner. What do you think of that?"</said> Laying her gloves away on the edge of the table her hand brushed against the vase of rusty red and yellow roses. A shower of faded petals fluttered onto her hand, her gloves, the table. She shook them off her hands.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"And do have him take these wretched roses away George. . . . I hate faded flowers."</said></p>

<p>Steam from the plated bowl of clams uncoiled in the rosy glow from the lampshade. Baldwin watched her fingers, pink and limber, pulling the clams by their long necks out of their shells, dipping them in melted butter, and popping them dripping in her mouth. She was deep in eating clams. He sighed. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Elaine . . . I'm a very unhappy man. . . . Seeing Gus McNiel's wife. It's the first time in years. Think of it I was crazy in love with her and now I cant remember what her first name was . . . Funny isn't it? Things had been extremely slow ever since I had set up in practice for myself. It was a rash thing to do, as I was only two years out of lawschool and had no money to run on. I was rash in those days. I'd decided that if I didn't get a case that day I'd chuck everything and go back to a clerkship. I went out for a walk to clear my head and saw a freightcar shunting down Eleventh Avenue run into a milkwagon. It was a horrid mess and when we'd picked the fellow up I said to myself I'd get him his rightful damages or bankrupt myself in the attempt. I won his case and that brought me to the notice of various people downtown, and that started him on his career and me on mine."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"So he drove a milkwagon did he? I think milkmen are the nicest people in the world. Mine's the cutest thing."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Elaine you wont repeat this to anyone. . . . I feel the completest confidence in you."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"That's very nice of you George. Isn't it amazing the way girls are getting to look more like Mrs. Castle every day? Just look round this room."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"She was like a wild rose Elaine, fresh and pink and full of the Irish, and now she's a rather stumpy businesslike looking little woman."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"And you're as fit as you ever were. That's the way it goes,"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I wonder. . . . You dont know how empty and hollow everything was before I met you. All Cecily and I can do is make each other miserable."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Where is she now?</said>"</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"She's up at Bar Harbor. . . . I had luck and all sorts of success when I was still a young man. . . . I'm not forty yet."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But I should think it would be fascinating. You must enjoy the law or you wouldn't be such a success at it."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh success . . . success . . . what does it mean?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'd like a little of it."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But my dear girl you have it."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh not what I mean."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But it isn't any fun any more. All I do is sit in the office and let the young fellows do the work. My future's all cut out for me. I suppose I could get solemn and pompous and practice little private vices . . . but there's more in me than that."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why dont you go into politics?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why should I go up to Washington into that greasy backwater when I'm right on the spot where they give the orders? The terrible thing about having New York go stale on you is that there's nowhere else. It's the top of the world. All we can do is go round and round in a squirrel cage."</said></p>

<p>Ellen was watching the people in light summer clothes dancing on the waxed square of floor in the center; she caught sight of Tony Hunter's oval pink and white face at a table on the far side of the room. Oglethorpe was not with him.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Who are you looking at?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Just some friends of Jojo's. . . . I wonder how on earth they got way out here. It's not exactly on that gang's beat."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Always the way when I try to get away with something,"</said> said Baldwin with a wry smile.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I should say you'd done exactly what you wanted to all your life."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh Elaine if you'd only let me do what I want to now. I want you to let me make you happy. You're such a brave little girl making your way all alone the way you do. By gad you are so full of love and mystery and glitter . . ." He faltered, took a deep swallow of wine, went on with flushing face. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I feel like a schoolboy . . . I'm making a fool of myself. Elaine I'd do anything in the world for you."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well all I'm going to ask you to do is to send away this lobster. I dont think it's terribly good."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"The devil . . . maybe it isn't. . . . Here waiter! . . . I was so rattled I didn't know I was eating it."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You can get me some supreme of chicken instead."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Surely you poor child you must be starved."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">". . . And a little corn on the cob. . . . I understand now why you make such a good lawyer, George. Any jury would have burst out sobbing long ago at such an impassioned plea."</said></p>

    </person> followed Bullock towards the bar.</p>

    <p>Crossing the room he caught sight of Ellen. Her hair was very red in the glow from the lamp beside her. Baldwin was leaning towards her across the table with moist lips and bright eyes. Jimmy felt something glittering go off in his chest like a released spring. He turned his head away suddenly for fear she should see him.</p>

<p>Bullock turned and nudged him in the ribs. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Say

<p>At the bar under a picture of the Lusitania stood a dark man in a white coat distended by a deep gorilla chest. He was vibrating a shaker between his very hairy hands. A waiter stood in front of the bar with a tray of cocktail glasses. The cocktail foamed into them greenishwhite.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello Congo,"</said> said 
<person key="JimmyHerf">

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Very please. You an Mr. 'Erf ave someting on the 'ouse sir."</said></p>



<p>The waiter raised the clinking tray of glasses to shoulder height and carried them out on the flat of his hand.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I suppose a gin fizz'll ruin all that whiskey but I'd like one. . . . Drink something with us wont you Congo?"</said> Bullock put a foot up on the brass rail and took a sip. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I was wondering,"</said> he said slowly, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"if there was any dope going round about this murder down the road."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Did you hear a shot?"</said></p>

    <p>Congo shook his head mysteriously. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I ear voices, very angree voices."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gosh I'm going to look into this,"</said> said Bullock tossing off the end of his drink. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Let's go back to the girls."</said></p>

<p>Ellen was looking at the face wrinkled like a walnut and the dead codfish eyes of the waiter pouring coffee. Baldwin was leaning back in his chair staring at her through his eyelashes. He was talking in a low monotone:</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Cant you see that I'll go mad if I cant have you. You are the only thing in the world I ever wanted."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"George I dont want to be had by anybody. . . . Cant you understand that a woman wants some freedom? Do be a sport about it. I'll have to go home if you talk like that."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why have you kept me dangling then? I'm not the sort of man you can play like a trout. You know that perfectly well."</said></p>

<p>She looked straight at him with wide gray eyes; the light gave a sheen of gold to the little brown specks in the iris.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's not so easy never to be able to have friends."</said> She looked down at her fingers on the edge of the table. His eyes were on the glint of copper along her eyelashes. Suddenly he snapped the silence that was tightening between them.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Anyway let's dance."</said></p>

<p>hummed Congo Jake as the big shining shaker quivered between his hairy hands. The narrow greenpapered bar was swelled and warped with bubbling voices, spiral exhalations of drinks, sharp clink of ice and glasses, an occasional strain of music from the other room.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But arent we rather far from the battlefield, Herf?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right let's dance. You must forgive me if I dance very badly."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'll kick you if you do anything wrong."</said></p>

<p>His arm was like plaster when he put it round her to dance with her. High ashy walls broke and crackled within him. He was soaring like a fireballoon on the smell of her hair.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Get up on your toes and walk in time to the music. . . . Move in straight lines that's the whole trick."</said> Her voice cut the quick coldly like a tiny flexible sharp metalsaw. Elbows joggling, faces set, gollywog eyes, fat men and thin women, thin women and fat men rotated densely about them. He was crumbling plaster with something that rattled achingly in his chest, she was an intricate machine of sawtooth steel whitebright bluebright copperbright in his arms. When they stopped her breast and the side of her body and her thigh came against him. He was suddenly full of blood steaming with sweat like a runaway horse. A breeze through an open door hustled the tobaccosmoke and the clotted pink air of the restaurant.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Herf I want to go down to see the murder cottage; please take me."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"As if I hadn't seen enough of X's marking the spot where the crime was committed."</said></p>



<p>In the hall George Baldwin stepped in front of them. He was pale as chalk, his black tie was crooked, the nostrils of his thin nose were dilated and marked with little veins of red.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hello George."</said></p>

<p>His voice croaked tartly like a klaxon. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Elaine I've been looking for you. I must speak to you. . . . Maybe you think I'm joking. I never joke."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Herf excuse me a minute. . . . Now what is the matter George? Come back to the table."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"George I was not joking either. . . . Herf do you mind ordering me a taxi?"</said></p>

<p>Baldwin grabbed hold of her wrist. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You've been playing with me long enough, do you hear me? Some day some man's going to take a gun and shoot you. You think you can play me like all the other little sniveling fools. . . . You're no better than a common prostitute."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Herf I told you to go get me a taxi."</said></p>

<p><person key="JimmyHerf">
    <persName>
        <forename>Jimmy</forename>
    </persName>
    </person> bit his lip and went out the front door.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Elaine what are you going to do?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"George I will not be bullied."</said></p>

<p>Something nickel flashed in Baldwin's hand. Gus McNiel stepped forward and gripped his wrist with a big red hand.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gimme that George. . . . For God's sake man pull yourself together."</said> He shoved the revolver into his pocket. Baldwin tottered to the wall in front of him. The trigger finger of his right hand was bleeding.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Here's a taxi,"</said> said Herf looking from one to another of the taut white faces.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All right you take the girl home. . . . No harm done, just a little nervous attack, see? No cause for alarm,"</said> McNiel was shouting in the voice of a man speaking from a soapbox. The headwaiter and the coatgirl were looking at each other uneasily. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Didn't nutten happen. . . . Gentleman's a little nervous . . . overwork you understand,"</said> McNiel brought his voice down to a reassuring purr. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You just forget it."</said></p>



<p>As they were getting into the taxi Ellen suddenly said in a little child's voice: <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I forgot we were going down to see the murder cottage. . . . Let's make him wait. I'd like to walk up and down in the air for a minute."</said> There was a smell of saltmarshes. The night was marbled with clouds and moonlight. The toads in the ditches sounded like sleighbells.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Is it far?"</said> she asked.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"No it's right down at the corner."</said></p>

<p>Their feet crackled on gravel then ground softly on macadam. A headlight blinded them, they stopped to let the car whir by; the exhaust filled their nostrils, faded into the smell of saltmarshes again.</p>

<p>It was a peaked gray house with a small porch facing the road screened with broken lattice. A big locust shaded it from behind. A policeman walked to and fro in front of it whistling gently to himself. A mildewed scrap of moon came out from behind the clouds for a minute, made tinfoil of a bit of broken glass in a gaping window, picked out the little rounded leaves of the locust and rolled like a lost dime into a crack in the clouds.</p>

<p>Neither of them said anything. They walked back towards the roadhouse.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Honestly Herf havent you seen 
<person key="StanwoodEmery">

</person>?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"No I havent an idea where he could be hiding himself."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"If you see him tell him I want him to call me up at once. . . . Herf what were those women called who followed the armies in the French Revolution?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Let's think. Was it cantonnières?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Something like that . . . I'd like to do that."</said></p>

<p>An electric train whistled far to the right of them, rattled nearer and faded into whining distance.</p>

<p>Dripping with a tango the roadhouse melted pink like a block of icecream.
<person key="JimmyHerf">
    <persName>
        <forename>Jimmy</forename>

    </person> was following her into the taxicab.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"No I want to be alone, Herf."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But I'd like very much to take you home. . . . I dont like the idea of letting you go all alone."</said></p>



<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Please as a friend I ask you."</said></p>

<p>They didnt shake hands. The taxi kicked dust and a rasp of burnt gasoline in his face. He stood on the steps reluctant to go back into the noise and fume.</p>

<p>Nellie McNiel was alone at the table. In front of her was the chair pushed back with his napkin on the back of it where her husband had sat. She was staring straight ahead of her; the dancers passed like shadows across her eyes. At the other end of the room she saw George Baldwin, pale and lean, walk slowly like a sick man to his table. He stood beside the table examining his check carefully, paid it and stood looking distractedly round the room. He was going to look at her. The waiter brought the change on a plate and bowed low. Baldwin swept the faces of the dancers with a black glance, turned his back square and walked out. Remembering the insupportable sweetness of Chinese lilies, she felt her eyes filling with tears. She took her engagement book out of her silver mesh bag and went through it hurriedly, marking carets with a silver pencil. She looked up after a little while, the tired skin of her face in a pucker of spite, and beckoned to a waiter. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Will you please tell Mr. McNiel that Mrs. McNiel wants to speak to him? He's in the bar."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sarajevo, Sarajevo; that's the place that set the wires on fire,"</said> Bullock was shouting at the frieze of faces and glasses along the bar.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Say bo," said Joe O'Keefe confidentially to no one in particular, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"a guy works in a telegraph office told me there'd been a big seabattle off St. John's, Newfoundland and the Britishers had sunk the German fleet of forty battleships."</said></said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Jiminy that'd stop the war right there."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But they aint declared war yet."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"How do you know? The cables are so choked up you cant get any news through."</said></p>



<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Did you see there were four more failures on Wall Street?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Tell me Chicago wheat pit's gone crazy."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"They ought to close all the exchanges till this blows over."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well maybe when the Germans have licked the pants off her England'll give Ireland her freedom."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But they are. . . . Stock market wont be open tomorrow."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"If a man's got the capital to cover and could keep his head this here would be the time to clean up."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well Bullock old man I'm going home,"</said> said

    </person>. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"This is my night of rest and I ought to be getting after it."</said></p>

    <p>Bullock winked one eye and waved a drunken hand. The voices in 
<person key="JimmyHerf">
    <persName>
        <forename>Jimmy</forename>
    </persName>
    </person>'s ears were throbbing elastic roar, near, far, near, far. Dies like a dog, march on he said. He'd spent all his money but a quarter. Shot at sunrise. Declaration of war. Commencement of hostilities. And they left him alone in his glory. Leipzig, the Wilderness, Waterloo, where the embattled farmers stood and fired the shot heard round . . . Cant take a taxi, want to walk anyway. Ultimatum. Trooptrains singing to the shambles with flowers on their ears. And shame on the false Etruscan who lingers in his home when . . .</p>

    <p>As he was walking down the gravel drive to the road an arm hooked in his.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Do you mind if I come along? I dont want to stay here."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Sure come ahead Tony I'm going to walk."</said></p>

<p>Herf walked with a long stride, looking straight ahead of him. Clouds had darkened the sky where remained the faintest milkiness of moonlight. To the right and left there was outside of the violetgray cones of occasional arclights black pricked by few lights, ahead the glare of streets rose in blurred cliffs yellow and ruddy.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You dont like me do you?"</said> said Tony Hunter breathlessly after a few minutes.</p>

<p>Herf slowed his pace. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why I dont know you very well. You seem to me a very pleasant person. . . ."</said></p>



<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Dont lie; there's no reason why you should. . . . I think I'm going to kill myself tonight."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Heavens! dont do that. . . . What's the matter?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You have no right to tell me not to kill myself. You dont know anything about me. If I was a woman you wouldnt be so indifferent."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What's eating you anyway?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm going crazy that's all, everything's so horrible. When I first met you with 
<person key="RuthPrynne">
    <persName>
        <forename>Ruth</forename> 
    </persName>
</person> one evening I thought we were going to be friends, Herf. You seemed so sympathetic and understanding. . . . I thought you were like me, but now you're getting so callous."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I guess it's the Times. . . . I'll get fired soon, don't worry."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'm tired of being poor; I want to make a hit."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well you're young yet; you must be younger than I am."</said> Tony didnt answer.</p>

<p>They were walking down a broad avenue between two rows of blackened frame houses. A streetcar long and yellow hissed rasping past.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Why we must be in Flatbush."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Herf I used to think you were like me, but now I never see you except with some woman."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What do you mean?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I've never told anybody in the world. . . . By God if you tell anybody. . . . When I was a child I was horribly oversexed, when I was about ten or eleven or thirteen."</said> He was sobbing. As they passed under an arclight, 
<person key="JimmyHerf">
    <persName>
        <forename>Jimmy</forename>
    </persName>
    </person> caught the glisten of the tears on his cheeks. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I wouldn't tell you this if I wasnt drunk."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But things like that happened to almost everybody when they were kids. . . . You oughtnt to worry about that."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But I'm that way now, that's what's so horrible. I cant like women. I've tried and tried. . . . You see I was caught. I was so ashamed I wouldn't go to school for weeks. My mother cried and cried. I'm so ashamed. I'm so afraid people will find out about it. I'm always fighting to keep it hidden, to hide my feelings."</said></p>



<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But it all may be an idea. You may be able to get over it. Go to a psychoanalyist."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I cant talk to anybody. It's just that tonight I'm drunk. I've tried to look it up in the encyclopedia. . . . It's not even in the dictionary."</said> He stopped and leaned against a lamppost with his face in his hands. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's not even in the dictionary."</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I hate them all. . . . It's not people like that I fall in love with. I hate myself. I suppose you'll hate me after tonight."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What nonsense. It's no business of mine."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Now you know why I want to kill myself. . . . Oh it's not fair Herf, it's not fair. . . . I've had no luck in my life. I started earning my living as soon as I got out of highschool. I used to be bellhop in summer hotels. My mother lived in Lakewood and I used to send her everything I earned. I've worked so hard to get where I am. If it were known, if there were a scandal and it all came out I'd be ruined."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But everybody says that of all juveniles and nobody lets it worry them."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Whenever I fail to get a part I think it's on account of that. I hate and despise all that kind of men. . . . I dont want to be a juvenile. I want to act. Oh it's hell. . . . It's hell."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But you're rehearsing now aren't you?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"A fool show that'll never get beyond Stamford. Now when you hear that I've done it you wont be surprised."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Done what?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Killed myself."</said></p>

<p>They walked without speaking. It had started to rain. Down the street behind the low greenblack shoebox houses there was an occasional mothpink flutter of lightning. A wet dusty smell came up from the asphalt beaten by the big plunking drops.</p>



<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"There ought to be a subway station near. . . . Isn't that a blue light down there? Let's hurry or we'll get soaked."</said></p>

    </person> took off his felt hat and swung it in one hand. The raindrops were cool on his forehead, the smell of the rain, of roofs and mud and asphalt, took the biting taste of whiskey and cigarettes out of his mouth.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gosh it's horrible,"</said> he shouted suddenly.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What?"</said></p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"All the hushdope about sex. I'd never realized it before tonight, the full extent of the agony. God you must have a rotten time. . . . We all of us have a rotten time. In your case it's just luck, hellish bad luck. Martin used to say: Everything would be so much better if suddenly a bell rang and everybody told everybody else honestly what they did about it, how they lived, how they loved. It's hiding things makes them putrefy. By God it's horrible. As if life wasn't difficult enough without that."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I'm going down into this subway station."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You'll have to wait hours for a train."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I cant help it I'm tired and I dont want to get wet."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well good night."</said></p>

Lightning flickered along the staring rows of dead windows. The rain seethed along the pavements, against storewindows, on brownstone steps. His knees were wet, a slow trickle started down his back, there were chilly cascades off his sleeves onto his wrists, his whole body itched and tingled. He walked on through Brooklyn. Obsession of all the beds in all the pigeonhole bedrooms, tangled sleepers twisted and strangled like the roots of potbound plants. Obsession of feet creaking on the stairs of lodginghouses, hands fumbling at doorknobs. Obsession of pounding temples and solitary bodies rigid on their beds.

    <p>They pair off hurriedly. Standing Up in Cars Strictly Forbidden. The climbing chain grates, grips the cogs; jerkily the car climbs the incline out of the whirring lights, out of the smell of crowds and steamed corn and peanuts, up jerkily grating up through the tall night of September meteors.</p>

<p>Sea, marshsmell, the lights of an Iron Steamboat leaving the dock. Across wide violet indigo a lighthouse blinks. Then the swoop. The sea does a flipflop, the lights soar. Her hair in his mouth, his hand in her ribs, thighs grind together.</p>

<p>The wind of their falling has snatched their yells, they jerk rattling upwards through the tangled girderstructure. Swoop. Soar. Bubbling lights in a sandwich of darkness and sea. Swoop. Keep Your Seats for the Next Ride.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh she wont care. She's just my mother; sit down, I'll git her."</said></p>

<p>Harland sat down on a chair beside the door in the dark kitchen and put his hands on his knees. He sat staring at his hands; they were red and dirtgrained and trembling, his tongue was like a nutmeg grater from the cheap whiskey he had been drinking the last week, his whole body felt numb and sodden and sour. He stared at his hands.</p>

<p>Joe O'Keefe came back into the kitchen. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"She's loin down. She says there's some soup on the back of the stove. . . . Here ye are. That'll make a man of ye. . . . Joe you ought to been where I was last night. Went out to this here Seaside Inn to take a message to the chief about somebody tippin him off that they was going to close the market. . . . It was the goddamnedest thing you ever saw in your life. This guy who's a wellknown lawyer down town was out in the hall bawlin out his gash about something. Jez he looked hard. And then he had a gun out an was goin to shoot her or some goddam thing when the chief comes up cool as you make em limpin on his stick like he does and took the gun away from him an put it in his pocket before anybody'd half seen what happened. . . . This guy Baldwin's a frien o his see? It was the goddamnedest thing I ever saw. Then he all crumpled up like. . . ."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"We'd have to help em. . . . Anyway I dont see how this can last long. The men who control international finance wont allow it. After all it's the banker who holds the purse strings."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"We wouldn't come to the help of England, no sir, not after the way they acted in Ireland and in the Revolution and in the Civil War. . . ."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Joey you're getting all choked up with that history you're reading up in the public library every night. . . .

Well I guess I'd better be going."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Naw stick around awhile, we'll open a bottle of glue."</said></p>

<p>They heard a heavy stumbling in the passage outside the kitchen.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Whossat?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Zat you Joe?"</said> A big towheaded boy with lumpy shoulders and a square red face and thickset neck lurched into the room.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"What the hell do you think this is? . . . This is my kid brother Mike."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well what about it?"</said> Mike stood swaying with his chin on his chest. His shoulders bulged against the low ceiling of the kitchen.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Aint he a whale? But for crissake Mike aint I told you not to come home when you was drinkin? . . . He's loible to tear the house down."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I got to come home sometime aint I? Since you got to be a wardheeler Joey you been pickin on me worsen the old man. I'm glad I aint goin to stay round this goddam town long. It's enough to drive a feller cookoo. If I can get on some kind of a tub that puts to sea before the Golden Gate by God I'm going to do it."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Hell I dont mind you stayin here. It's just that I dont like you raisin hell all the time, see?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You get outa here, Mike. . . . Come back home when you're sober."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'd like to see you put me outa here, git me? I'd like to see you put me outa here."</said></p>

<p>Harland got to his feet. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I'm going," he said. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Got to see if I can get that job."</said></p>

<p>Mike was advancing across the kitchen with his fists clenched. Joey's jaw set; he picked up a chair.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'll crown you with it."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"O saints and martyrs cant a woman have no peace in her own house?"</said> A small grayhaired woman ran screaming between them; she had lustrous black eyes set far apart in a face shrunken like a last year's apple; she beat the air with worktwisted hands. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Shut yer traps both of ye, always cursing an fightin round the house like there warnt no God. . . . Mike you go upstairs an lay down on your bed till yer sober."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I was jus tellin him that,"</said> said Joey.</p>

<p>She turned on Harland, her voice like the screech of chalk on a blackboard. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"An you git along outa here. I dont allow no drunken bums in my house. Git along outa here. I dont care who brought you."</said></p>

<p>Harland looked at Joey with a little sour smile, shrugged his shoulders and went out. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Charwoman,"</said> he muttered as he stumbled with stiff aching legs along the dusty street of darkfaced brick houses.</p>

<p>The sultry afternoon sun was like a blow on his back. Voices in his ears of maids, charwomen, cooks, stenographers, secretaries: Yes sir, Mr. Harland, Thank you sir Mr. Harland. Oh sir thank you sir so much sir Mr. Harland sir. . . .</p>

<p>Red buzzing in her eyelids the sunlight wakes her, she sinks back into purpling cottonwool corridors of sleep, wakes again, turns over yawning, pulls her knees up to her chin to pull the drowsysweet cocoon tighter about her. A truck jangles shatteringly along the street, the sun lays hot stripes on her back. She yawns desperately and twists herself over and lies wide awake with her hands under her head staring at the ceiling. From far away through streets and housewalls the long moan of a steamboat whistle penetrates to her like a blunt sprout of crabgrass nudging through gravel. Ellen sits up shaking her head to get rid of a fly blundering about her face. The fly flashes and vanishes in the sunlight, but somewhere in her there lingers a droning pang, unaccountable, something left over from last night's bitter thoughts. But she is happy and wide awake and it's early. She gets up and wanders round the room in her nightgown.</p>

<p>Where the sun hits it the hardwood floor is warm to the soles of her feet. Sparrows chirp on the windowledge. From upstairs comes the sound of a sewingmachine. When she gets out of the bath her body feels smoothwhittled and tense; she rubs herself with a towel, telling off the hours of the long day ahead; take a walk through junky littered downtown streets to that pier on the East River where they pile the great beams of mahogany, breakfast all alone at the Lafayette, coffee and crescent rolls and sweet butter, go shopping at Lord & Taylor's early before everything is stuffy and the salesgirls wilted, have lunch with . . . Then the pain that has been teasing all night wells up and bursts. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"

        </person> for God's sake,"</said> she says aloud. She sits before her mirror staring in the black of her own dilating pupils.</p>

        <p>She dresses in a hurry and goes out, walks down Fifth Avenue and east along Eighth Street without looking to the right or left. The sun already hot simmers slatily on the pavements, on plateglass, on dustmarbled enameled signs. Men's and women's faces as they pass her are rumpled and gray like pillows that have been too much slept on. After crossing Lafayette Street roaring with trucks and delivery wagons there is a taste of dust in her mouth, particles of grit crunch between her teeth. Further east she passes pushcarts; men are wiping off the marble counters of softdrink stands, a grindorgan fills the street with shiny jostling coils of the Blue Danube, acrid pungence spreads from a picklestand. In Tompkins Square yelling children mill about the soggy asphalt. At her feet a squirming heap of small boys, dirty torn shirts, slobbering mouths, punching, biting, scratching; a squalid smell like moldy bread comes from them. Ellen all of a sudden feels her knees weak under her. She turns and walks back the way she came.</p>

<p>The sun is heavy like his arm across her back, strokes her bare forearm the way his fingers stroke her, it's his breath against her cheek.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Nothing but the five statutory questions,"</said> said Ellen to the rawboned man with big sagging eyes like oysters into whose long shirtfront she was talking.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"And so the decree is granted?"</said> he asked solemnly.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Surely in an uncontested . . ."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Well I'm very sorry to hear it as an old family friend of both parties."</said></p>



<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Look here Dick, honestly I'm very fond of Jojo. I owe him a great deal. . . . He's a very fine person in many ways, but it absolutely had to be."</said></p>

<p></p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You mean there is somebody else?"</said></p>

<p></p>She looked up at him with bright eyes and half nodded.</p>

<p></p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh but divorce is a very serious step my dear young lady."</said></p>

<p></p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh not so serious as all that."</said></p>

<p></p>They saw Harry Goldweiser coming towards them across the big walnut paneled room. She suddenly raised her voice. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"They say that this battle of the Marne is going to end the war."</said></p>

<p></p>Harry Goldweiser took her hand between his two pudgy-palmed hands and bowed over it. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's very charming of you Elaine to come and keep a lot of old midsummer bachelors from boring each other to death. Hello Snow old man, how's things?"</said></p>

<p></p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Yes how is it we have the pleasure of still finding you here?"</said></p>

<p></p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh various things have held me. . . . Anyway I hate summer resorts."</said> <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Nowhere prettier than Long Beach anyway. . . . Why Bar Harbor, I wouldnt go to Bar Harbor if you gave me a million . . . a cool million."</said></p>

<p></p>Mr. Snow let out a gruff sniff. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Seems to me I've heard you been going into the realestate game down there, Goldweiser,"</said></p>

<p></p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I bought myself a cottage that's all. It's amazing you cant even buy yourself a cottage without every newsboy on Times Square knowing about it. Let's go in and eat; my sister'll be right here."</said> A dumpy woman in a spangled dress came in after they had sat down to table in the big antlerhung diningroom; she was pigeonbreasted and had a sallow skin.</p>

<p></p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh Miss Oglethorpe I'm so glad to see you," she twittered in a little voice like a parrakeet's. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I've often seen you and thought you were the loveliest thing. . . . I did my best to get Harry to bring you up to see me."</said></p>



<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"This is my sister Rachel,"</said> said Goldweiser to Ellen without getting up. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"She keeps house for me."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I wish you'd help me, Snow, to induce Miss Oglethorpe to take that part in The Zinnia Girl. . . . Honest it was just written for you."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But it's such a small part . . ."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's not a lead exactly, but from the point of view of your reputation as a versatile and exquisite artist, it's the best thing in the show."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Will you have a little more fish, Miss Oglethorpe?"</said> piped Miss Goldweiser.</p>

<p>Mr. Snow sniffed, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"There's no great acting any more: Booth, Jefferson, Mansfield ... all gone. Nowadays it's all advertising; actors and actresses are put on the market like patent medicines. Isn't it the truth Elaine? . . . Advertising, advertising."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But that isn't what makes success. . . . If you could do it with advertising every producer in New York'd be a millionaire,"</said> burst in Goldweiser. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"It's the mysterious occult force that grips the crowds on the street and makes them turn in at a particular theater that makes the receipts go up at a particular boxoffice, do you understand me? Advertising wont do it, good criticism wont do it, maybe it's genius maybe it's luck but if you can give the public what it wants at that time and at that place you have a hit. Now that's what Elaine gave us in this last show. . . . She established contact with the audience. It might have been the greatest play in the world acted by the greatest actors in the world and fallen a flat failure. . . . And I dont know how you do it, nobody dont know how you do it. . . . You go to bed one night with your house full of paper and you wake up the next morning with a howling success. The producer cant control it any more than the weather man can control the weather. Aint I tellin the truth?"</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Ah the taste of the New York public has sadly degenerated since the old days of Wallack's."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"But there have been some beautiful plays,"</said> chirped Miss Goldweiser.</p>



<p>The long day love was crisp in the curls . . . the dark curls . . . broken in the dark steel light . . . hurls . . . high O God high into the bright . . . She was cutting with her fork in the crisp white heart of a lettuce. She was saying words while quite other words spilled confusedly inside her like a broken package of beads. She sat looking at a picture of two women and two men eating at a table in a high paneled room under a shivering crystal chandelier. She looked up from her plate to find Miss Goldweiser's little birdeyes kindly querulous fixed hard on her face.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh yes New York is really pleasanter in midsummer than any other time; there's less hurry and bustle."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Oh yes that's quite true Miss Goldweiser." Ellen flashed a sudden smile round the table. . . . All the long day love Was crisp in the curls of his high thin brow, Flashed in his eyes in dark steel light. . . .</p>

<p>In the taxi Goldweiser's broad short knees pressed against hers; his eyes were full of furtive spiderlike industry weaving a warm sweet choking net about her face and neck. Miss Goldweiser had relapsed pudgily into the seat beside her. Dick Snow was holding an unlighted cigar in his mouth, rolling it with his tongue. Ellen tried to remember exactly how 
    <person key="StanwoodEmery">

            <addName type="nickname">Stan</addName>
        </persName>
    </person> looked, his polevaulter's tight slenderness; she couldn't remember his face entire, she saw his eyes, lips, an ear.</p>

    <p></p>Times Square was full of juggled colored lights, criss-crossed corrugations of glare. They went up in the elevator at the Astor. Ellen followed Miss Goldweiser across the roofgarden among the tables. Men and women in evening dress, in summer muslins and light suits turned and looked after her, like sticky tendrils of vines glances caught at her as she passed. The orchestra was playing In My Harem. They arranged themselves at a table.</p>

<p></p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Shall we dance?"</said> asked Goldweiser.</p>

<p></p>She smiled a wry broken smile in his face as she let him put his arm round her back. His big ear with solemn lonely hairs on it was on the level of her eyes.</p>

<p></p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Elaine,"</said> he was breathing into her ear, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"honest I thought I was a wise guy."</said> He caught his breath . . . <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"but I aint. . . . You've got me goin Httle girl and I hate to admit it. . . . Why cant you like me a little bit? I'd like . . . us to get married as soon as you get your decree. . . . Wouldn't you be kinder nice to me once in a while . . .? I'd do anything for you, you know that. . . . There are lots of things in New York I could do for you. . . ."</said> The music stopped. They stood apart under a palm. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Elaine come over to my office and sign that contract. I had Ferrari wait. . . . We can be back in fifteen minutes."</said></p>

<p></p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I've got to think it over . . . I never do anything without sleeping on it."</said></p>

<p></p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Gosh you drive a feller wild."</said></p>

<p>Suddenly she remembered

        </persName>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh Ellie I'm so glad to see you. . . ."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"This is Mr, Emery, Mr. Goldweiser. . . ."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I've been on the most exordinately spectacular trip, honestly you should have come. . . . We went to Montreal and Quebec and came back through Niagara Falls and we never drew a sober breath from the time we left little old New York till they arrested us for speeding on the Boston Post Road, did we Pearline?"</said> Ellen was staring at a girl who stood groggily behind 
    <person key="StanwoodEmery">
        <persName>
            <addName type="nickname">Stan</addName>
        </persName>
    </person> with a small flowered straw hat pulled down over a pair of eyes the blue of watered milk.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Ellie this is Pearline. . . . Isn't it a fine name? I almost split when she told me what it was. . . . But you dont know the joke. . . . We got so tight in Niagara Falls that when we came to we found we were married. . . . And we have pansies on our marriage license. . . ."</said></p>

<p>Ellen couldnt see his face. The orchestra, the jangle of voices, the clatter of plates spouted spiraling louder and louder about her . . .</p>

<p>And the ladies of the harem</p>

<p>Knew exactly how to wear 'em</p>

<p>In O-riental Bagdad long ago. . . .</p>



<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Good night

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh Ellie I wish you'd come partying with us. . . ."</said></p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Thanks . . . thanks."</said></p>

<p>She started to dance again with Harry Goldweiser. The roofgarden was spinning fast, then less fast. The noise ebbed sickeningly. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Excuse me a minute Harry,"</said> she said.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I'll come back to the table."</said> In the ladies' room she let herself down carefully on the plush sofa. She looked at her face in the round mirror of her vanity case. From black pinholes her pupils spread blurring till everything was black.</p>

    </person>'s legs were tired; he had been walking all afternoon. He sat down on a bench beside the Aquarium and looked out over the water. The fresh September wind gave a glint of steel to the little crisp waves of the harbor and to the slateblue smutted sky. A big white steamer with a yellow funnel was passing in front of the statue of Liberty. The smoke from the tug at the bow came out sharply scalloped like paper. In spite of the encumbering wharfhouses the end of Manhattan seemed to him like the prow of a barge pushing slowly and evenly down the harbor. Gulls wheeled and cried. He got to his feet with a jerk. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"Oh hell I've got to do something."</said></p>

    <p>He stood a second with tense muscles balanced on the balls of his feet. The ragged man looking at the photogravures of a Sunday paper had a face he had seen before. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Hello," he said vaguely. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"I knew who you were all along,"</said> said the man without holding out his hand. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true">"You're Lily Herf's boy . . .

    <p>The leaden twilight weighs on the dry limbs of an old man walking towards Broadway. Round the Nedick's stand at the corner something clicks in his eyes. Broken doll in the ranks of varnished articulated dolls he plods up with drooping head into the seethe and throb into the furnace of beaded lettercut light. "I remember when it was all meadows," he grumbles to the little boy.</p>

Outside it is raining. One more river, O there's one more river to cross. He straightens the lapels of his coat, arranges his mouth soberly, pays two dollars and goes into a big resounding hall hung with red white and blue bunting. Reeling, so he leans for a while against the wall. One more river . . . The dancefloor full of jogging couples rolls like the deck of a ship. The bar is more stable. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Gus McNiel's here," everybody's saying <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Good old Gus."

        </person>jumps with his eyes closed into a thicket of fists. He's slammed in the eye, in the jaw, shoots like out of a gun out into the drizzling cool silent street. Ha ha ha.</p>

        <p>For I am a bachelor and I live all alone</p>

<p>And there's one more river to cross</p>

<p>One more river to Jordan</p>

<p>One more river to cross . . .</p>




<p>It was blowing cold in his face and he was sitting on the front of a ferryboat when he came to. His teeth were chattering, he was shivering . . . "I'm having DT's. Who am I? Where am I? City of New York, State of New York. . . . Stanwood Emery age twentytwo occupation student. . . . Pearline Anderson twentyone occupation actress. To hell with her. Gosh I've got fortynine dollars and eight cents and where the hell have I been? And nobody rolled me. Why I havent got the DT's at all. I feel fine, only a little delicate. All I need's a little drink, dont you? Hello, I thought there was somebody here. I guess I'd better shut up."</p>

<p>Fortynine dollars ahanging on the wall</p>



<p>Across the zinc water the tall walls, the birchlike cluster of downtown buildings shimmered up the rosy morning like a sound of horns through a chocolatebrown haze. As the boat drew near the buildings densened to a granite mountain split with knifecut canyons. The ferry passed close to a tubby steamer that rode at anchor listing towards

        </person> so that he could see all the decks. An Ellis Island tug was alongside. A stale smell came from the decks packed with upturned faces like a load of melons. Three gulls wheeled complaining. A gull soared in a spiral, white wings caught the sun, the gull skimmed motionless in whitegold light. The rim of the sun had risen above the plumcolored band of clouds behind East New York. A million windows flashed with light. A rasp and a humming came from the city.</p>

        <p>The animals went in two by two</p>

<p>The elephant and the kangaroo</p>

<p>There's one more river to Jordan</p>

<p>One more river to cross</p>



<p>In the whitening light tinfoil gulls wheeled above broken boxes, spoiled cabbageheads, orangerinds heaving slowly between the splintered plank walls, the green spumed under the round bow as the ferry skidding on the tide, gulped the broken water, crashed, slid, settled slowly into the slip. Handwinches whirled with jingle of chains, gates folded upward.

        </person> stepped across the crack, staggered up the manuresmelling wooden tunnel of the ferryhouse out into the sunny glass and benches of the Battery. He sat down on a bench, clasped his hands round his knees to keep them from shaking so. His mind went on jingling like a mechanical piano.</p>

        <p>With bells on her fingers and rings on her toes</p>

<p>Shall ride a white lady upon a great horse</p>

<p>And she shall make mischief wherever she goes . . .</p>




<p>There was Babylon and Nineveh, they were built of brick. Athens was goldmarble columns. Rome was held up on broad arches of rubble. In Constantinople the minarets flame like great candles round the Golden Horn. . . . O there's one more river to cross. Steel glass, tile, concrete will be the materials of the skyscrapers.

    </person> bided his time and caught it. He shot headlong through the open door and down the long hall shouting Pearline into the livingroom. It smelled funny, Pearline's smell, to hell with it. He picked up a chair; the chair wanted to fly, it swung round his head and crashed into the window, the glass shivered and tinkled. He looked out through the window. The street stood up on end. A hookandladder and a fire engine were climbing it licketysplit trailing a droning sirenshriek. Fire fire, pour on water, Scotland's burning. A thousand dollar fire, a hundredthousand dollar fire, a million dollar fire. Skyscrapers go up like flames, in flames, flames. He spun back into the room. The table turned a somersault. The chinacloset jumped on the table. Oak chairs climbed on top to the gas jet. Pour on water, Scotland's burning. Don't like the smell in this place in the City of New York, County of New York, State of New York. He lay on his back on the floor of the revolving kitchen and laughed and laughed. The only man who survived the flood rode a great lady on a white horse. Up in flames, up, up. Kerosene whispered a greasy faced can in the corner of the kitchen. Pour on water. He stood swaying on the crackling upside down chairs on the upside down table. The kerosene licked him with a white cold tongue. He pitched, grabbed the gas jet, the gas jet gave way, he lay in a puddle on his back striking matches, wet wouldn't light. A match spluttered, lit; he held the flame carefully between his hands.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Oh yes but my husband's awfully ambitious." Pearline was telling the blue gingham lady in the grocery-store. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Likes to have a good time an all that but he's much more ambitious than anybody I every knew. He's goin to get his old man to send us abroad so he can study architecture. He wants to be an architect."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"My that'll be nice for you wont it? A trip like that . . . Anything else miss?" "No I guess I didn't forget anythin. . . . If it was anybody else I'd be worryin about him. I haven't seen him for two days. Had to go and see his dad I guess."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"And you just newly wed too."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I wouldnt be tellin ye if I thought there was anythin wrong, would I? No he's playin straight all right. . . . Well goodby Mrs. Robinson." She tucked her packages under one arm and swinging her bead bag in the free hand walked down the street. The sun was still warm although there was a tang of fall in the wind. She gave a penny to a blind man cranking the Merry Widow waltz out of a grindorgan. Still she'd better bawl him out a little when he came home, might get to doing it often. She turned into 200th Street. People were looking out of windows, there was a crowd gathering. It was a fire. She sniffed the singed air. It gave her gooseflesh; she loved seeing fires. She hurried. Why it's outside our building. Outside our apartmenthouse. Smoke dense as gunnysacks rolled out of the fifthstory window. She suddenly found herself all atremble. The colored elevatorboy ran up to her. His face was green. "Oh it's in our apartment" she shrieked, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"and the furniture just came a week ago. Let me get by." The packages fell from her, a bottle of cream broke on the sidewalk. A policeman stood in her way, she threw herself at him and pounded on the broad blue chest. She couldnt stop shrieking. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"That's all right little lady, that's all right," he kept booming in a deep voice. As she beat her head against it she could feel his voice rumbling in his chest. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"They're bringing him down, just overcome by smoke that's all, just overcome by smoke."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"O Stanwood my husband," she shrieked. Everything was blacking out. She grabbed at two bright buttons on the policeman's coat and fainted.</p>

    <head>VIII. One More River to Jordan</head>



    <p>A MAN is shouting from a soapbox at Second Avenue and Houston in front of the Cosmopolitan Cafè: <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>". . . these fellers, men . . . wageslaves like I was . . . are sittin on your chest . . . they're takin the food outen your mouths. Where's all the pretty girls I used to see walkin up and down the bullevard? Look for em in the up-town cabarets. . . . They squeeze us dry friends . . . feller workers, slaves I'd oughter say . . . they take our work and our ideers and our women. . . . They build their Plaza Hotels and their millionaire's clubs and their million dollar theayters and their battleships and what do they leave us? . . . They leave us shopsickness an the rickets and a lot of dirty streets full of garbage cans. . . . You look pale you fellers. . . . You need blood. . . . Why dont you get some blood in your veins? . . . Back in Russia the poor people . . . not so much poorer'n we are . . . believe in wampires, things come suck your blood at night. . . . That's what Capitalism is, a wampire that sucks your blood . . . day . . . and . . . night."</p>

    <p>It is beginning to snow. The flakes are giltedged where they pass the streetlamp. Through the plate glass the Cosmopolitan Cafe full of blue and green opal rifts of smoke looks like a muddy aquarium: faces blob whitely round the tables like illassorted fishes. Umbrellas begin to bob in clusters up the snowmottled street. The orator turns up his collar and walks briskly east along Houston, holding the muddy soapbox away from his trousers.</p>



    <p>Faces, hats, hands, newspapers jiggled in the fetid roaring subway car like corn in a popper. The downtown express passed clattering in yellow light, window telescoping window till they overlapped like scales.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Look George," said Sandbourne to George Baldwin who hung on a strap beside him, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"you can see Fitzgerald's contraction."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I'll be seeing the inside of an undertaking parlor if I dont get out of this subway soon."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"It does you plutocrats good now and then to see how the other half travels. . . . Maybe it'll make you induce some of your little playmates down at Tammany Hall to stop squabbling and give us wageslaves a little transportation. . . . cristamighty I could tell em a thing or two. . . . My idea's for a series of endless moving platforms under Fifth Avenue."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Did you cook that up when you were in hospital Phil?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I cooked a whole lot of things up while I was in hospital."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Look here lets get out at Grand Central and walk. I cant stand this. . . . I'm not used to it."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Sure . . . I'll phone Elsie I'll be a little late to dinner. . . . Not often I get to see you nowadays George . . . Gee it's like the old days."</p>

    <p>In a tangled clot of men and women, arms, legs, hats aslant on perspiring necks, they were pushed out on the platform. They walked up Lexington Avenue quiet in the claretmisted afterglow.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"But Phil how did you come to step out in front of a truck that way?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Honestly George I dunno. . . . The last I remember is craning my neck to look at a terribly pretty girl went by in a taxicab and there I was drinking icewater out of a teapot in the hospital."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Shame on you Phil at your age."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Cristamighty dont I know it? But I'm not the only one."</p>



    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"It is funny the way a thing like that comes over you. . . . Why what have you heard about me?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Gosh George dont get nervous, it's all right. . . . I've seen her in The Zinnia Girl. . . . She walks away with it. That other girl who's the star dont have a show."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Look here Phil if you hear any rumors about Miss Oglethorpe for Heaven's sake shut them up. It's so damn silly you cant go out to tea with a woman without everybody starting their dirty gabble all over town. . . . By God I will not have a scandal, I dont care what happens."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Say hold your horses George."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I'm in a very delicate position downtown just at the moment that's all. . . . And then Cecily and I have at last reached a modus vivendi. . . . I wont have it disturbed."</p>

    <p>They walked along in silence.</p>

    <p>Sandbourne walked with his hat in his hand. His hair was almost white but his eyebrows were still dark and bushy. Every few steps he changed the length of his stride as if it hurt him to walk. He cleared his throat. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"George you were asking me if I'd cooked up any schemes when I was in hospital. . . . Do you remember years ago old man Specker used to talk about vitreous and superenameled tile? Well I've been workin on his formula out at Hollis. . . . A friend of mine there has a two thousand degree oven he bakes pottery in. I think it can be put on a commercial basis. . . . Man it would revolutionize the whole industry. Combined with concrete it would enormously increase the flexibility of the materials at the architects' disposal. We could make tile any color, size or finish. . . . Imagine this city when all the buildins instead of bein dirty gray were ornamented with vivid colors. Imagine bands of scarlet round the entablatures of skyscrapers. Colored tile would revolutionize the whole life of the city. . . . Instead of fallin back on the orders or on gothic or romanesque decorations we could evolve new designs, new colors, new forms. If there was a little color in the town all this hardshell inhibited life'd break down. . . . There'd be more love an less divorce. . . ."</p>

    <p>Baldwin burst out laughing. "You tell em Phil. . . . I'll talk to you about that sometime. You must come up to dinner when Cecily's there and tell us about it. . . . Why wont Parkhurst do anything?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I wouldnt let him in on it. He'd cotton on to the proposition and leave me out in the cold once he had the formula. I wouldn't trust him with a rubber nickel."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Why doesnt he take you into partnership Phil?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"He's got me where he wants me anyway. . . . He knows I do all the work in his goddamned office. He knows too that I'm too cranky to make out with most people. He's a slick article."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Still I should think you could put it up to him."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"He's got me where he wants me and he knows it, so I continue doin the work while he amasses the coin. . . . I guess it's logical. If I had more money I'd just spend it. I'm just shiftless."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"But look here man you're not so much older than I am. . . . You've still got a career ahead of you."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Sure nine hours a day draftin. . . . Gosh I wish you'd go into this tile business with me."</p>

    <p>Baldwin stopped at a corner and slapped his hand on the briefcase he was carrying. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Now Phil you know I'd be very glad to give you a hand in any way I could. . . . But just at the moment my financial situation is terribly involved. I've gotten into some rather rash entanglements and Heaven knows how I'm going to get out of them. . . . That's why I cant have a scandal or a divorce or anything. You dont understand how complicatedly things interact. . . . I couldnt take up anything new, not for a year at least. This war in Europe has made things very unsettled downtown. Anything's liable to happen."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"All right. Good night George."</p>

    <p>Sandbourne turned abruptly on his heel and walked down the avenue again. He was tired and his legs ached. It was almost dark. On the way back to the station the grimy brick and brownstone blocks dragged past monotonously like the days of his life.</p>



    <p>Under the skin of her temples iron clamps tighten till her head will mash like an egg; she begins to walk with long strides up and down the room that bristles with itching stuffiness; spotty colors of pictures, carpets, chairs wrap about her like a choking hot blanket. Outside the window the backyards are striped with blue and lilac and topaz of a rainy twilight. She opens the window. No time to get tight like the twilight, Stan said. The telephone reached out shivering beady tentacles of sound. She slams the window down. O hell cant they give you any peace?</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Why Harry I didnt know you were back. . . . Oh I wonder if I can. . . . Oh yes I guess I can. Come along by after the theater. . . . Isnt that wonderful? You must tell me all about it." She no sooner puts the receiver down than the bell clutches at her again. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Hello. . . . No I dont. . . . Oh yes maybe I do. . . . When did you get back?" She laughed a tinkling telephone laugh. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"But Howard I'm terribly busy. . . . Yes I am honestly. . . . Have you been to the show? Well sometime come round after a performance. . . . I'm so anxious to hear about your trip . . . you know . . . Goodby Howard."</p>

    <p>A walk'll make me feel better. She sits at her dressingtable and shakes her hair down about her shoulders. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"It's such a hellish nuisance, I'd like to cut it all off . . . spreads apace. The shadow of white Death. . . . Oughtnt to stay up so late, those dark circles under my eyes. . . . And at the door, Invisible Corruption. . . . If I could only cry; there are people who can cry their eyes out, really cry themselves blind . . . Anyway the divorce'll go through. . . .</p>

    <p>Far from the shore, far from the trembling throng</p>

    <p>Whose sails were never to the tempest given</p>





    <p>Gosh it's six o'clock already. She starts walking up and down the room again. I am borne darkly fearfully afar. . . . The phone rings. "Hello. . . . Yes this is Miss Oglethorpe. . . . Why hello 
   <person key="RuthPrynne">
      <persName>
        <forename>Ruth</forename> 
      </persName>
    </person>, why I haven't seen you for ages, since Mrs. Sunderland's. . . . Oh, do I'd love to see you. Come by and we'll have a bite to eat on the way to the theater. . . . It's the third floor."</p>

<p>She rings off and gets a raincape out of a closet. The smell of furs and mothballs and dresses clings in her nostrils. She throws up the window again and breathes deep of the wet air full of the cold rot of autumn. She hears the burring boom of a big steamer from the river. Darkly, fearfully afar from this nonsensical life, from this fuzzy idiocy and strife; a man can take a ship for his wife, but a girl. The telephone is shiveringly beadily ringing, ringing.</p>

<p>The buzzer burrs at the same time. Ellen presses the button to click the latch. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Hello. . . . No, I'm very sorry I'm afraid you'll have to tell me who it is. Why Larry Hopkins I thought you were in Tokyo. . . . They havent moved you again have they? Why of course we must see each other. . . . My dear it's simply horrible but I'm all dated up for two weeks. . . . Look I'm sort of crazy tonight. You call up tomorrow at twelve and I'll try to shift things around. . . .

Then the tension in her snaps, she feels something draining out of her like water out of a washbasin. She quietly puts a dab of rouge on her lips.</p>

<p>When she goes back she says in her usual voice: <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Well let's get along. . . . Got a part yet 
<person key="RuthPrynne">

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I had a chance to go out to Detroit with a stock company. I turned it down. ... I wont go out of New York whatever happens."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"What wouldnt I give for a chance to get away from New York. . . . Honestly if I was offered a job singing in a movie in Medicine Hat I think I'd take it."</p>

<p>Ellen picks up her umbrella and the three women file down the stairs and out into the street. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Taxi," calls Ellen.</p>

<p>The passing car grinds to a stop. The red hawk face of the taxidriver craning into the light of the street lamp. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Go to Eugenie's on Fortyeighth Street," says Ellen as the others climb in. Greenish lights and darks flicker past the lightheaded windows.</p>

<p>She stood with her arm in the arm of Harry Goldweiser's dinner jacket looking out over the parapet of the roof garden. Below them the Park lay twinkling with occasional lights, streaked with nebular blur like a fallen sky. From behind them came gusts of a tango, inklings of voices, shuffle of feet on a dancefloor. Ellen felt a stiff castiron figure in her metalgreen evening dress.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Ah but Boirnhardt, Rachel, Duse, Mrs. Siddons. . . . No Elaine I'm tellin you, d'you understand? There's no art like the stage that soars so high moldin the passions of men. . . . If I could only do what I wanted we'd be the greatest people in the world. You'd be the greatest actress. . . . I'd be the great producer, the unseen builder, d'you understand? But the public dont want art, the people of this country wont let you do anythin for em. All they want's a detective melodrama or a rotten French farce with the kick left out or a lot of pretty girls and music. Well a showman's business is to give the public what they want."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I think that this city is full of people wanting inconceivable things. . . . Look at it."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"It's all right at night when you cant see it. There's no artistic sense, no beautiful buildins, no old-time air, that's what's the matter with it."</p>

<p>They stood a while without speaking. The orchestra began playing the waltz from The Lilac Domino. Suddenly Ellen turned to Goldweiser and said in a curt tone.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Can you understand a woman who wants to be a harlot, a common tart, sometimes?"</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"My dear young lady what a strange thing for a sweet lovely girl to suddenly come out and say."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I suppose you're shocked." She didnt hear his answer. She felt she was going to cry. She pressed her sharp nails into the palms of her hands, she held her breath until she had counted twenty. Then she said in a choking little girl's voice, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Harry let's go and dance a little."</p>

<p>The sky above the cardboard buildings is a vault of beaten lead. It would be less raw if it would snow. Ellen finds a taxi on the corner of Seventh Avenue and lets herself sink back in the seat rubbing the numb gloved fingers of one hand against the palm of the other. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"West Fiftyseventh, please." Out of a sick mask of fatigue she watches fruitstores, signs, buildings being built, trucks, girls, messengerboys, policemen through the jolting window. If I have my child,

She presses her knees together, sits up straight on the edge of the seat with her hands clasped over her slender belly. O God the rotten joke they've played on me, taking

<p>As she stands on the gray pavement fumbling in her purse for a bill, a dusteddy swirling scraps of paper along the gutter fills her mouth with grit. The elevatorman's face is round ebony with ivory inlay. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Mrs. Staunton Wells?" <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Yas ma'am eighth floor."</p>

<p>The elevator hums as it soars. She stands looking at herself in the narrow mirror. Suddenly something recklessly gay goes through her. She rubs the dust off her face with a screwedup handkerchief, smiles at the elevatorman's smile that's wide as the full keyboard of a piano, and briskly rustles to the door of the apartment that a frilled maid opens. Inside it smells of tea and furs and flowers, women's voices chirp to the clinking of cups like birds in an aviary. Glances flicker about her head as she goes into the room.</p>

<p>There was wine spilled on the tablecloth and bits of tomatosauce from the spaghetti. The restaurant was a steamy place with views of the Bay of Naples painted in soupy blues and greens on the walls. Ellen sat back in her chair from the round tableful of young men, watching the smoke from her cigarette crinkle spirally round the fat Chiantibottle in front of her. In her plate a slab of tri-color icecream melted forlornly. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"But good God hasnt a man some rights? No, this industrial civilization forces us to seek a complete readjustment of government and social life . . ."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Doesnt he use long words?" Ellen whispered to Herf who sat beside her.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"He's right all the same," he growled back at her. . . .</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"The result has been to put more power in the hands of a few men than there has been in the history of the world since the horrible slave civilizations of Egypt and Mesopotamia. . . ."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Hear hear."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"No but I'm serious. . . . The only way of bucking the interests is for working people, the proletariat, producers and consumers, anything you want to call them, to form unions and finally get so well organized that they can take over the whole government."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I think you're entirely wrong, Martin, it's the interests as you call em, these horrible capitalists, that have built up this country as we have it today."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Well look at it for God's sake. . . . That's what I'm saying. I wouldnt kennel a dog in it."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I dont think so. I admire this country. . . . It's the only fatherland I've got. . . . And I think that all these downtrodden masses really want to be downtrodden, they're not fit for anything else. . . . If they werent they'd be flourishing businessmen . . . Those that are any good are getting to be."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"But I don't think a flourishing businessman is the highest ideal of human endeavor."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"A whole lot higher than a rotten fiddleheaded anarchist agitator. . . . Those that arent crooks are crazy."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Look here Mead, you've just insulted something that you dont understand, that you know nothing about. . . . I cant allow you to do that. . . . You should try to understand things before you go round insulting them."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"An insult to the intelligence that's what it is all this socialistic drivel."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"It's just a little hot in here. . . . Whee, what a relief. . . . I hate arguments anyway. I never can think of anything to say."</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"That bunch does nothing but chew the rag night after night."</p>

<p>Eighth Avenue was full of fog that caught at their throats. Lights bloomed dimly through it, faces loomed, glinted in silhouette and faded like a fish in a muddy aquarium.</p>

<p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Lots."</p>

       <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Oh Ellie I want to say something to you . . ."</p>

       <p>The door closed behind her.</p>

    </person> stood stockstill at the foot of the brownstone steps. His temples throbbed. He wanted to break the door down after her. He dropped on his knees and kissed the step where she had stood. The fog swirled and flickered with colors in confetti about him. Then the trumpet feeling ebbed and he was falling through a black manhole. He stood stockstill. A policeman's ballbearing eyes searched his face as he passed, a stout blue column waving a nightstick. Then suddenly he clenched his fists and walked off. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"O God everything is hellish," he said aloud. He wiped the grit off his lips with his coatsleeve.</p>

    <p>She puts her hand in his to jump out of the roadster as the ferry starts, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Thanks Larry," and follows his tall ambling body out on the bow. A faint riverwind blows the dust and gasoline out of their nostrils. Through the pearly night the square frames of houses along the Drive opposite flicker like burnedout fireworks. The waves slap tinily against the shoving bow of the ferry. A hunchback with a violin is scratching Marianela.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Nothing succeeds like success," Larry is saying in a deep droning voice.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Oh if you knew how little I cared about anything just now you wouldnt go on teasing me with all these words. . . . You know, marriage, success, love, they're just words."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"But they mean everything in the world to me. . . . I think you'd like it in Lima Elaine. . . . I waited until you were free, didnt I? And now here I am."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"We're none of us that ever. . . . But I'm just numb." The riverwind is brackish. Along the viaduct above 125th Street cars crawl like beetles. As the ferry enters the slip they hear the squudge and rumble of wheels on asphalt.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Well we'd better get back into the car, you wonderful creature Elaine."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"After all day it's exciting isnt it Larry, getting back into the center of things."</p>

    <p>Beside the smudged white door are two pushbuttons marked Night Bell and Day Bell. She rings with a shaky finger, A short broad man with a face like a rat and sleek black hair brushed straight back opens. Short dollhands the color of the flesh of a mushroom hang at his sides. He hunches his shoulders in a bow.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Are you the lady? Come in."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Is this Dr. Abrahms?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Yes. . . . You are the lady my friend phoned me about. Sit down my dear lady." The office smells of something like arnica. Her heart joggles desperately between her ribs.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"You understand . . ." She hates the quaver in her voice; she's going to faint. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"You understand, Dr. Abrahms that it is absolutely necessary. I am getting a divorce from my husband and have to make my own living."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Very young, unhappily married . . . I am sorry." The doctor purrs softly as if to himself. He heaves a hissing sigh and suddenly looks in her eyes with black steel eyes like gimlets. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Do not be afraid, dear lady, it is a very simple operation. . . . Are you ready now?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Yes. It wont take very long will it? If I can pull myself together I have an engagement for tea at five."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"You are a brave young lady. In an hour it will be forgotten. . . . I am sorry. . . . It is very sad such a thing is necessary. . . . Dear lady you should have a home and many children and a loving husband . . . Will you go in the operating room and prepare yourself. . . . I work without an assistant."</p>

    <p>The bright searing bud of light swells in the center of the ceiling, sprays razorsharp nickel, enamel, a dazzling sharp glass case of sharp instruments. She takes off her hat and lets herself sink shuddering sick on a little enamel chair. Then she gets stiffly to her feet and undoes the band of her skirt.</p>

    <p>The roar of the streets breaks like surf about a shell of throbbing agony. She watches the tilt of her leather hat, the powder, the rosed cheeks, the crimson lips that are a mask on her face. All the buttons of her gloves are buttoned. She raises her hand. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Taxi!" A fire engine roars past, a hosewagon with sweatyfaced men pulling on rubber coats, a clanging hookandladder. All the feeling in her fades with the dizzy fade of the siren. A wooden Indian, painted, with a hand raised at the streetcorner.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Taxi!"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Yes ma'am."</p>

Oh I cant go home just yet. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Driver go to the Old English Tea Room on Fortieth Street please." She opened her long green leather purse and looked in.

He's gotten to be a ham actor if there ever was one, something was jeering inside her all the while. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Thank heavens you will never know." . . . Then with a sweep of his broadbrimmed hat and a toss of his silky white hair, as if he were playing in Monsieur Beaucaire, he had turned and walked off among the crowd up Broadway. I may be down on my luck, but I'm not all ham inside the way he is. . . . Cancer he said. She looked up and down the car at the joggling faces opposite her. Of all those people one of them must have it. Four Out of Every Five Get . . . Silly, that's not cancer. Ex-lax, Nujol, O'Sullivan's. . . . She put her hand to her throat. Her throat was terribly swollen, her throat throbbed feverishly. Maybe it was worse. It is something alive that grows in flesh, eats all your life, leaves you horrible, rotten. . . . The people opposite stared straight ahead of them, young men and young women, middleaged people, green faces in the dingy light, under the sourcolored advertisements. Four Out of Every Five . . . A trainload of jiggling corpses, nodding and swaying as the express roared shrilly towards Ninetysixth Street. At Ninetysixth she had to change for the local.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Hello Dutch. . . . I thought I'd never get here." A grayfaced girl in a red hat and gray rabbit coat sat down beside him.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Jez I'm sick o readin want ads." He stretched out his arms and yawned letting the paper slip down his legs.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Aint you chilly, sittin out here on the bridge?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Maybe I am. . . . Let's go and eat." He jumped to his feet and put his red face with its thin broken nose close to hers and looked in her black eyes with his pale gray eyes. He tapped her arm sharply. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Hello Francie. . . . How's my lil girl?"</p>

    <p>They walked back towards Manhattan, the way she had come. Under them the river glinted through the mist. A big steamer drifted by slowly, lights already lit; over the edge of the walk they looked down the black smokestacks.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Was it a boat as big as that you went overseas on Dutch?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Bigger 'n that."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Gee I'd like to go."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I'll take you over some time and show you all them places over there . . . I went to a lot of places that time I went A.W.O.L."</p>

    <p>In the L station they hesitated. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Francie got any jack on you?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Sure I got a dollar. . . . I ought to keep that for tomorrer though."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"All I got's my last quarter. Let's go eat two fiftyfive cent dinners at that chink place . . . That'll be a dollar ten."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I got to have a nickel to get down to the office in the mornin."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Oh Hell! Goddam it I wish we could have some money."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Got anything lined up yet?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Wouldn't I have told ye if I had?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Come ahead I've got a half a dollar saved up in my room. I can take carfare outa that." She changed the dollar and put two nickels into the turnstile. They sat down in a Third Avenue train.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Say Francie will they let us dance in a khaki shirt?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Why not Dutch it looks all right."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I feel kinder fussed about it."</p>

    <p>The jazzband in the restaurant was playing Hindustan. It smelled of chop suey and Chinese sauce. They slipped into a booth. Slickhaired young men and little bobhaired girls were dancing hugged close. As they sat down they smiled into each other's eyes.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Jez I'm hungry."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Are you Dutch?"</p>

    <p>He pushed forward his knees until they locked with hers. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Gee you're a good kid," he said when he had finished his soup. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Honest I'll get a job this week. And then we'll get a nice room an get married an everything."</p>

    <p>When they got up to dance they were trembling so they could barely keep time to the music.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Mister . . . no dance without ploper dless . . ." said a dapper Chinaman putting his hand on Dutch's arm.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Waz he want?" he growled dancing on.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I guess it's the shirt, Dutch."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"The hell it is."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I'm tired. I'd rather talk than dance anyway . . ." They went back to their booth and their sliced pineapple for dessert.</p>

    <p>Afterwards they walked east along Fourteenth. "Dutch cant we go to your room?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I ain't got no room. The old stiff wont let me stay and she's got all my stuff. Honest if I dont get a job this week I'm goin to a recruiting sergeant an re-enlist."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Oh dont do that; we wouldn't ever get married then Dutch. . . . Gee though why didn't you tell me?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I didn't want to worry you Francie. . . . Six months out of work . . . Jez it's enough to drive a guy cookoo."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"But Dutch where can we go?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"We might go out that wharf. . . . I know a wharf."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"It's so cold."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I couldn't get cold when you were with me kid."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Dont talk like that. . . I dont like it."</p>

    <p>They walked leaning together in the darkness up the muddy rutted riverside streets, between huge swelling gas-tanks, brokendown fences, long manywindowed warehouses. At a corner under a streetlamp a boy catcalled as they passed.</p>



    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I'll poke your face in you little bastard," Dutch let fly out of the corner of his mouth.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Dont answer him," Francie whispered, <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"or we'll have the whole gang down on us."</p>

    <p>They slipped through a little door in a tall fence above which crazy lumberpiles towered. They could smell the river and cedarwood and sawdust. They could hear the river lapping at the piles under their feet. Dutch drew her to him and pressed his mouth down on hers.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Hay dere dont you know you cant come out here at night disaway?" a voice yapped at them. The watchman flashed a lantern in their eyes.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"All right keep your shirt on, we were just taking a little walk."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Some walk."</p>

    <p>They were dragging themselves down the street again with the black riverwind in their teeth.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Look out." A policeman passed whistling softly to himself. They drew apart. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Oh Francie they'll be takin us to the nuthouse if we keep this up. Let's go to your room."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Landlady'll throw me out, that's all."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I wont make any noise. . . . You got your key aint ye? I'll sneak out before light. Goddam it they make you feel like a skunk."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"All right Dutch let's go home. . . . I dont care no more what happens."</p>

    <p>They walked up mudtracked stairs to the top floor of the tenement.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Take off your shoes," she hissed in his ear as she slipped the key in the lock.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I got holes in my stockings."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"That dont matter, silly. I'll see if it's all right. My room's way back past the kitchen so if they're all in bed they cant hear us."</p>

    <p>When she left him he could hear his heart beating. In a second she came back. He tiptoed after her down a creaky hall. A sound of snoring came through a door. There was a smell of cabbage and sleep in the hall. Once in her room she locked the door and put a chair against it under the knob. A triangle of ashen light came in from the street. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Now for crissake keep still Dutch." One shoe still in each hand he reached for her and hugged her. He lay beside her whispering on and on with his lips against her ear. "And Francie I'll make good, honest I will; I got to be a sergeant overseas till they busted me for goin A.W.O.L. That shows I got it in me. Onct I get a chance I'll make a whole lot of jack and you an me'll go back an see Chateau Teery an Paree an all that stuff; honest you'd like it Francie . . . Jez the towns are old and funny and quiet and cozylike an they have the swellest ginmills where you sit outside at little tables in the sun an watch the people pass an the food's swell too once you get to like it an they have hotels all over where we could have gone like tonight an they dont care if your married or nutten. An they have big beds all cozy made of wood and they bring ye up breakfast in bed. Jez Francie you'd like it."</p>

    <p>They were walking to dinner through the snow. Big snowfeathers spun and spiraled about them mottling the glare of the streets with blue and pink and yellow, blotting perspectives.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Ellie I hate to have you take that job. . . . You ought to keep on with your acting."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"But <person key="JimmyHerf">
                <persName>
                    <addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName>
                </persName>
            </person>, we've got to live."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I know . . . I know. You'd certainly didnt have your wits about you Ellie when you married me."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Oh let's not talk about it any more."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Do let's have a good time tonight. . . . It's the first snow."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Is this the place?" They stood before an unlighted basement door covered by a closemeshed grating. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Let's try."</p>



    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Did the bell ring?"</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I think so."</p>

    <p>The inner door opened and a girl in a pink apron peered out at them. <said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Bon soir mademoiselle."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Ah . . . bon soir monsieur 'dame." She ushered them into a foodsmelling gaslit hall hung with overcoats and hats and mufflers. Through a curtained door the restaurant blew in their faces a hot breath of bread and cocktails and frying butter and perfumes and lipsticks and clatter and jingling talk.</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"I can smell absinthe," said Ellen. "Let's get terribly tight."</p>

    <p><said who="#" aloud="true" direct="true"></said>"Good Lord, there's Congo. . . . Dont you remember Congo Jake at the Seaside Inn?"</p>

    <p>He stood bulky at the end of the corridor beckoning to them. His face was very tanned and he had a glossy black mustache. "Hello Meester 'Erf. . . . Ow are you?"</p>

    <p>"Fine as silk. Congo I want you to meet my wife."</p>

    <p>"If you dont mind the keetchen we will 'ave a drink."</p>

    <p>"Of course we dont. . . . It's the best place in the house. Why you're limping. . . . "What did you do to your leg?"</p>

    <p>"Foutu . . . I left it en Italie. . . . I couldnt breeng it along once they'd cut it off."</p>

    <p>"How was that?"</p>

    <p>"Damn fool thing on Mont Tomba. . . . My bruderinlaw e gave me a very beautiful artificial leemb. . . . Sit 'ere. Look madame now can you tell which is which?"</p>

    <p>"No I cant," said Ellie laughing. They were at a little marble table in the corner of the crowded kitchen. A girl was dishing out at a deal table in the center. Two cooks worked over the stove. The air was rich with sizzling fatty foodsmells. Congo hobbled back to them with three glasses on a small tray. He stood over them while they drank.</p>

    <p>"Salut," he said, raising his glass. "Absinthe cocktail, like they make it in New Orleans."</p>

    <p>"It's a knockout." Congo took a card out of his vest pocket:</p>



    <p>MARQUIS DES COULOMMIERS</p>

    <p>Imports</p>

    <p>Riverside 11121</p>



    <p>"Maybe some day you need some little ting . . . I deal in nutting but prewar imported. I am the best bootleggair in New York.</p>

    <p>"If I ever get any money I certainly will spend it on you Congo. . . . How do you find business?"</p>

    <p>"Veree good. . . . I tell you about it. Tonight I'm too busee. . . . Now I find you a table in the restaurant."</p>

    <p>"Do you run this place too?"</p>

    <p>"No this my bruderinlaw's place."</p>

    <p>"I didnt know you had a sister."</p>

    <p>"Neither did I."</p>

    <p>When Congo limped away from their table silence came down between them like an asbestos curtain in a theater.</p>

    <p>"He's a funny duck," said 
        <person key="JimmyHerf">
        <persName>
            <forename>Jimmy</forename>
        </persName>
        </person> forcing a laugh.</p>

    <p>"He certainly is."</p>

    <p>"Look Ellie let's have another cocktail."</p>

    <p>"Allright."</p>

    <p>"I must get hold of him and get some stories about bootleggers out of him."</p>

    <p>When he stretched his legs out under the table he touched her feet. She drew them away. 
        <person key="JimmyHerf">
        <persName>
            <forename>Jimmy</forename>
        </persName>
        </person> could feel his jaws chewing, they clanked so loud under his cheeks he thought Ellie must hear them. She sat opposite him in a gray tailoredsuit, her neck curving up heartbreakingly from the ivory V left by the crisp frilled collar of her blouse, her head tilted under her tight gray hat, her lips made up; cutting up little pieces of meat and not eating them, not saying a word.</p>

    <p>"Gosh . . . let's have another cocktail." He felt paralyzed like in a nightmare; she was a porcelaine figure under a bellglass. A current of fresh snowrinsed air from somewhere eddied all of a sudden through the blurred packed jangling glare of the restaurant, cut the reek of food and drink and tobacco. For an instant he caught the smell of her hair. The cocktails burned in him. God I dont want to pass out.</p>

    <p>Sitting in the restaurant of the Gare de Lyon, side by side on the black leather bench. His cheek brushes hers when he reaches to put herring, butter, sardines, anchovies, sausage on her plate. They eat in a hurry, gobbling, giggling, gulp wine, start at every screech of an engine. . . .</p>

    <p>The train pulls out of Avignon, they two awake, looking in each other's eyes in the compartment full of sleep-sodden snoring people. He lurches clambering over tangled legs, to smoke a cigarette at the end of the dim oscillating corridor. Diddledeump, going south, Diddledeump, going south, sing the wheels over the rails down the valley of the Rhone. Leaning in the window, smoking a broken cigarette, trying to smoke a crumbling cigarette, holding a finger over the torn place. Glubglub glubglub from the bushes, from the silverdripping poplars along the track.</p>

    <p>"EUie, Ellie there are nightingales singing along the track."</p>

    <p>"Oh I was asleep darling." She gropes to him stumbling across the legs of sleepers. Side by side in the window in the lurching jiggling corridor.</p>

    <p>Deedledeump, going south. Gasp of nightingales along the track among the silverdripping poplars. The insane cloudy night of moonlight smells of gardens garlic rivers freshdunged field roses. Gasp of nightingales.</p>

    <p>Opposite him the Elliedoll was speaking. "He says the lobstersalad's all out. . . . Isnt that discouraging?"</p>

    <p>Suddenly he had his tongue. "Gosh if that were the only thing."</p>

    <p>"What do you mean?"</p>

    <p>"Why did we come back to this rotten town anyway?"</p>

    <p>"You've been burbling about how wonderful it was ever since we came back."</p>

    <p>"I know. I guess it's sour grapes. . . . I'm going to have another cocktail. . . . Ellie for heaven's sake what's the matter with us?"</p>

    <p>"We're going to be sick if we keep this up I tell you."</p>

    <p>"Well let's be sick. . . . Let's be good and sick."</p>



    <p>When they sit up in the great bed they can see across the harbor, can see the yards of a windjammer and a white sloop and a red and green toy tug and plainfaced houses opposite beyond a peacock stripe of water; when they lie down they can see gulls in the sky. At dusk dressing rockily, shakily stumbling through the mildewed corridors of the hotel out into streets noisy as a brass band, full of tambourine rattle, brassy shine, crystal glitter, honk and whir of motors. . . . Alone together in the dusk drinking sherry under a broad-leaved plane, alone together in the juggled particolored crowds like people invisible. And the spring night comes up over the sea terrible out of Africa and settles about them.</p>

    <p>They had finished their coffee. <person key="JimmyHerf">
        <persName>
            <forename>Jimmy</forename>
        </persName>
        </person> had drunk his very slowly as if some agony waited for him when he finished it.</p>

    <p>"Well I was afraid we'd find the Barneys here," said Ellen.</p>

    <p>"Do they know about this place?"</p>

    <p>"You brought them here yourself 
        <person key="JimmyHerf">
            <persName>
                <addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName>

        </person>. . . . And that dreadful woman insisted on talking babies with me all the evening. I hate talking babies."</p>

    <p>"Gosh I wish we could go to a show."</p>

    <p>"It would be too late anyway."</p>

    <p>"And just spending money I havent got. . . . Lets have a cognac to top off with. I don't care if it ruins us."</p>

    <p>"It probably will in more ways than one."</p>

    <p>"Well Ellie, here's to the breadwinner who's taken up the white man's burden."</p>

    <p>"Why 
        <person key="JimmyHerf">
        <persName>
            <forename>Jimmy</forename>
        </persName>
        </person> I think it'll be rather fun to have an editorial job for a while."</p>

    <p>"I'd find it fun to have any kind of job. . . . Well I can always stay home and mind the baby."</p>

    <p>"Dont be so bitter 
        <person key="JimmyHerf">
        <persName>
            <forename>Jimmy</forename>
        </persName>
        </person>, it's just temporary."</p>

    <p>"Life's just temporary for that matter."</p>

    <p>The taxi drew up. 
        <person key="JimmyHerf">
        <persName>
            <forename>Jimmy</forename>
        </persName>
        </person> paid him with his last dollar. Ellie had her key in the outside door. The street was a confusion of driving absintheblurred snow. The door of their apartment closed behind them. Chairs, tables, books, windowcurtains crowded about them bitter with the dust of yesterday, the day before, the day before that. Smells of diapers and coffeepots and typewriter oil and Dutch Cleanser oppressed them. Ellen put out the empty milkbottle and went to bed. 
        <person key="JimmyHerf">
            <persName>
                <forename>Jimmy</forename>
            </persName>
            </person> kept walking nervously about the front room. His drunkenness ebbed away leaving him icily sober. In the empty chamber of his brain a doublefaced word clinked like a coin: Success Failure, Success Failure.</p>

    <p>I'm just wild about Harree</p>

    <p>And Harry's just wild about me</p>




    <p>she hums under her breath as she dances. It's a long hall with a band at one end, lit greenishly by two clusters of electric lights hanging among paper festoons in the center. At the end where the door is, a varnished rail holds back the line of men. This one Anna's dancing with is a tall square built Swede, his big feet trail clumsily after her tiny lightly tripping feet. The music stops. Now it's a little blackhaired slender Jew. He tries to snuggle close.</p>

    <p>"Quit that." She holds him away from her.</p>

    <p>"Aw have a heart."</p>

    <p>She doesn't answer, dances with cold precision; she's sickeningly tired.</p>

    <p>Me and my boyfriend</p>

    <p>My boyfriend and I</p>





    <p>An Italian breathes garlic in her face, a marine sergeant, a Greek, a blond young kid with pink cheeks, she gives him a smile; a drunken elderly man who tries to kiss her . . . Charley my boy O Charley my boy . . . slickhaired, freckled rumplehaired, pimplefaced, snubnosed, straightnosed, quick dancers, heavy dancers. . . . Goin souf. . . . Wid de taste o de sugarcane right in my mouf . . . against her back big hands, hot hands, sweaty hands, cold hands, while her dancechecks mount up, get to be a wad in her fist. This one's a good waltzer, genteel-like in a black suit.</p>

    <p>"Gee I'm tired," she whispers.</p>

    <p>"Dancing never tires me."</p>

    <p>"Oh it's dancin with everybody like this."</p>

    <p>"Dont you want to come an dance with me all alone somewhere?"</p>

    <p>"Boyfrien's waitin for me after."</p>

    <p>With nothing but a photograph</p>

    <p>To tell my troubles to . . .</p>

    <p>What'll I do . . .?</p>





    <p>"What time's it?" she asks a broadchested wise guy. "Time you an me was akwainted, sister. . . ." She shakes her head. Suddenly the music bursts into Auld Lang Syne. She breaks away from him and runs to the desk in a crowd of girls elbowing to turn in their dancechecks. "Say Anna," says a broadhipped blond girl . . . "did ye see that sap was dancin wid me? . . . He says to me the sap he says See you later an I says to him the sap I says see yez in hell foist . . . an then he says, Goily he says . . ."</p>

    <head>III. Revolving Doors</head> <!-- Laura -->

    <p>Glowworm trains shuttle in the gloaming through the foggy looms of spiderweb bridges, elevators soar and drop in their shafts, harbor lights wink.</p>

    <p>Like sap at the first frost at five o'clock men and women begin to drain gradually out of the tall buildings downtown, grayfaced throngs flood subways and tubes, vanish underground.</p>

    <p>All night the great buildings stand quiet and empty, their million windows dark. Drooling light the ferries chew tracks across the lacquered harbor. At midnight the fourfunneled express steamers slide into the dark out of their glary berths. Bankers blearyeyed from secret conferences hear the hooting of the tugs as they are let out of side doors by lightningbug watchmen; they settle grunting into the back seats of limousines, and are whisked uptown into the Forties, clinking streets of ginwhite whiskey-yellow ciderfizzling lights.</p>



    <p>SHE sat at the dressingable coiling her hair. He stood over her with the lavender suspenders hanging from his dress trousers prodding the diamond studs into his shirt with stumpy fingers.</p>

    <p>"Jake I wish we were out of it," she whined through the hairpins in her mouth.</p>

    <p>"Out of what Rosie?"</p>

    <p>"The Prudence Promotion Company. . . . Honest I'm worried."</p>

    <p>"Why everything's goin swell. We've got to bluff out Nichols that's all."</p>

    <p>"Suppose he prosecutes?"</p>

    <p>"Oh he wont. He'd lose a lot of money by it. He'd much better come in with us. . . . I can pay him in cash in a week anyways. If we can keep him thinkin we got money we'll have him eatin out of our hands. Didn't he say he'd be at the El Fey tonight?"</p>

    <p>Rosie had just put a rhinestone comb into the coil of her black hair. She nodded and got to her feet. She was a plump broadhipped woman with big black eyes and high-arched eyebrows. She wore a corset trimmed with yellow lace and a pink silk chemise.</p>

    <p>"Put on everythin you've got Rosie. I want yez all dressed up like a Christmas tree. We're goin to the El Fey an stare Nichols down tonight. Then tomorrer I'll go round and put the proposition up to him. . . . Lets have a little snifter anyways . . ." He went to the phone. "Send up some cracked ice and a couple of bottles of White Rock to four o four. Silverman's the name. Make it snappy."</p>

    <p>"Jake let's make a getaway," Rosie cried suddenly. She stood in the closet door with a dress over her arm. "I cant stand all this worry. . . . It's killin me. Let's you an me beat it to Paris or Havana or somewheres and start out fresh."</p>

    <p>"Then we would be up the creek. You can be extradited for grand larceny. Jez you wouldnt have me goin round with dark glasses and false whiskers all my life."</p>

    <p>Rosie laughed. "No I guess you wouldnt look so good in a fake zit. . . . Oh I wish we were really married at least."</p>

    <p>"Dont make no difference between us Rosie. Then they'd be after me for bigamy too. That'd be pretty."</p>

    <p>Rosie shuddered at the bellboy's knock. Jake Silverman put the tray with its clinking bowl of ice on the bureau and fetched a square whiskeybottle out of the wardrobe.</p>

    <p>"Dont pour out any for me. I havent got the heart for it."</p>

    <p>"Kid you've got to pull yourself together. Put on the glad rags an we'll go to a show. Hell I been in lots o tighter holes than this." With his highball in his hand he went to the phone. "I want the newsstand. . . . Hello cutie. . . . Sure I'm an old friend of yours. . . . Sure you know me. . . . Look could you get me two seats for the Follies. . . . That's the idear. . . . No I cant sit back of the eighth row. . . . That's a good little girl. . . . An you'll call me in ten minutes will you dearie?"</p>

    <p>"Say Jake is there really any borax in that lake?"</p>

    <p>"Sure there is. Aint we got the affidavit of four experts?"</p>

    <p>"Sure. I was just kinder wonderin. . . . Say Jake if this ever gets wound up will you promise me not to go in for any more wildcat schemes?"</p>

    <p>"Sure; I wont need to. . . . My you're a redhot mommer in that dress."</p>

    <p>"Do you like it?"</p>

    <p>"You look like Brazil . . . I dunno . . . kinder tropical."</p>

    <p>"That's the secret of my dangerous charm."</p>

    <p>The phone rang jingling sharp. They jumped to their feet. She pressed the side of her hand against her lips.</p>

    <p>"Two in the fourth row. That's fine. . . . We'll be right down an get em . . . Jez Rosie you cant go on being jumpy like; you're gettin me all shot too. Pull yerself together why cant you?"</p>

    <p>"Let's go out an eat Jake. I havent had anything but buttermilk all day. I guess I'll stop tryin to reduce. This worryin'll make me thin enough."</p>

    <p>"You got to quit it Rosie. . . . It's gettin my nerve."</p>

    <p>They stopped at the flowerstall in the lobby. "I want a gardenia" he said. He puffed his chest out and smiled his curlylipped smile as the girl fixed it in the buttonhole of his dinnercoat. "What'll you have dear?" he turned grandiloquently to Rosie. She puckered her mouth. "I dont just know what'll go with my dress."</p>

    <p>"While you're deciding I'll go get the theater tickets." With his overcoat open and turned back to show the white puffedout shirtfront and his cuffs shot out over his thick hands he strutted over to the newsstand. Out of the corner of her eye while the ends of the red roses were being wrapped in silver paper Rosie could see him leaning across the magazines talking babytalk to the blond girl. He came back brighteyed with a roll of bills in his hand. She pinned the roses on her fur coat, put her arm in his and together they went through the revolving doors into the cold glistening electric night. "Taxi," he yapped.</p>

    <p>The diningroom smelled of toast and coffee and the New York Times. The Merivales were breakfasting to electric light. Sleet beat against the windows. "Well Paramount's fallen off five points more," said James from behind the paper,</p>

    <p>"Oh James I think its horrid to be such a tease," whined Maisie who was drinking her coffee in little henlike sips, "And anyway," said Mrs. Merivale, "Jack's not with Paramount any more. He's doing publicity for the Famous Players."</p>

    <p>"He's coming east in two weeks. He says he hopes to be here for the first of the year."</p>

    <p>"Did you get another wire Maisie?"</p>

    <p>Maisie nodded. "Do you know James, Jack never will write a letter. He always telegraphs," said Mrs. Merivale through the paper at her son. "He certainly keeps the house choked up with flowers," growled James from behind the paper.</p>

    <p>"All by telegraph," said Mrs. Merivale triumphantly.</p>

    <p>James put down his paper. "Well I hope he's as good a fellow as he seems to be."</p>

    <p>"Oh James you're horrid about Jack. . . . I think it's mean." She got to her feet and went through the curtains into the parlor.</p>

    <p>"Well if he's going to be my brother-in-law, I think I ought to have a say in picking him," he grumbled.</p>

    <p>Mrs. Merivale went after her, "Come back and finish your breakfast Maisie, he's just a terrible tease."</p>

    <p>"I wont have him talk that way about Jack."</p>

    <p>"But Maisie I think Jack's a dear boy." She put her arm round her daughter and led her back to the table. "He's so simple and I know he has good impulses. . . . I'm sure he's going to make you very happy." Maisie sat down again pouting under the pink bow of her boudoir cap. "Mother may I have another cup of coffee?"</p>

    <p>"Deary you know you oughtnt to drink two cups. Dr. Fernald said that was what was making you so nervous."</p>

    <p>"Just a little bit mother very weak. I want to finish this muffin and I simply cant eat it without something to wash it down, and you know you dont want me to lose any more weight." James pushed back his chair and went out with the Times under his arm. "It's half past eight James," said Mrs. Merivale. "He's likely to take an hour when he gets in there with that paper."</p>

    <p>"Well," said Maisie peevishly. "I think I'll go back to bed. I think it's silly the way we all get up to breakfast. There's something so vulgar about it mother. Nobody does it any more. At the Perkinses' it comes up to you in bed on a tray."</p>

    <p>"But James has to be at the bank at nine."</p>

    <p>"That's no reason why we should drag ourselves out of bed. That's how people get their faces all full of wrinkles."</p>

    <p>"But we wouldn't see James until dinnertime, and I like to get up early. The morning's the loveliest part of the day." Maisie yawned desperately.</p>

    <p>James appeared in the doorway to the hall running a brush round his hat.</p>

    <p>"What did you do with the paper James?"</p>

    <p>"Oh I left it in there."</p>

    <p>"I'll get it, never mind. . . . My dear you've got your stickpin in crooked. I'll fix it. . . . There." Mrs. Merivale put her hands on his shoulders and looked in her son's face. He wore a dark gray suit with a faint green stripe in it, an olive green knitted necktie with a small gold nugget stickpin, olive green woolen socks with black clockmarks and dark red Oxford shoes, their laces neatly tied with doubleknots that never came undone. "James arent you carrying your cane?" He had an olive green woolen muffler round his neck and was slipping into his dark brown winter overcoat."I notice the younger men down there dont carry them, mother . . . People might think it was a little . . . I dont know . . ."</p>

    <p>"But Mr. Perkins carries a cane with a gold parrothead."</p>

    <p>"Yes but he's one of the vicepresidents, he can do what he likes. . . . But I've got to run." James Merivale hastily kissed his mother and sister. He put on his gloves going down in the elevator. Ducking his head into the sleety wind he walked quickly east along Seventysecond. At the subway entrance he bought a Tribune and hustled down the steps to the jammed soursmelling platform.</p>

    <p>Chicago! Chicago! came in bursts out of the shut phonograph. Tony Hunter, slim in a black closecut suit, was dancing with a girl who kept putting her mass of curly ashblond hair on his shoulder. They were alone in the hotel sitting room.</p>

    <p>"Sweetness you're a lovely dancer," she cooed snuggling closer.</p>

    <p>"Think so Nevada?"</p>

    <p>"Um-hum . . . Sweetness have you noticed something about me?"</p>

    <p>"What's that Nevada?"</p>

    <p>"Havent you noticed something about my eyes?"</p>

    <p>"They're the loveliest little eyes in the world."</p>

    <p>"Yes but there's something about them."</p>

    <p>"You mean that one of them's green and the other one brown."</p>

    <p>"Oh it noticed the tweet lil ting." She tilted her mouth up at him. He kissed it. The record came to an end. They both ran over to stop it. "That wasnt much of a kiss, Tony," said Nevada Jones tossing her curls out of her eyes. They put on Shuffle Along.</p>

    <p>"Say Tony," she said when they had started dancing again. "What did the psychoanalyst say when you went to see him yesterday?"</p>

    <p>"Oh nothing much, we just talked," said Tony with a sigh. "He said it was all imaginary. He suggested I get to know some girls better. He's all right. He doesn't know what he's talking about though. He cant do anything."</p>

    <p>"I bet you I could."</p>

    <p>They stopped dancing and looked at each other with the blood burning in their faces.</p>

    <p>"Knowing you Nevada," he said in a doleful tone "has meant more to me . . . You're so decent to me. Everybody's always been so nasty."</p>

    <p>"Aint he solemn though?" She walked over thoughtfully and stopped the phonograph.</p>

    <p>"Some joke on George I'll say."</p>

    <p>"I feel horribly about it. He's been so decent. . . . And after all I could never have afforded to go to Dr. Baumgardt at all."</p>

    <p>"It's his own fault. He's a damn fool. . . . If he thinks he can buy me with a little hotel accommodation and theater tickets he's got another think coming. But honestly Tony you must keep on with that doctor. He did wonders with Glenn Gaston. . . . He thought he was that way until he was thirtyfive years old and the latest thing I hear he's married an had a pair of twins. . . . Now give me a real kiss sweetest. Thataboy. Let's dance some more. Gee you're a beautiful dancer. Kids like you always are. I dont know why it is. . . ."</p>

    <p>The phone cut into the room suddenly with a glittering sawtooth ring. "Hello. . . . Yes this is Miss Jones. . . . Why of course George I'm waiting for you. . . ." She put up the receiver. "Great snakes, Tony beat it. I'll call you later. Dont go down in the elevator you'll meet him coming up." Tony Hunter melted out the door. Nevada put Baby . . . Babee Deevine on the phonograph and strode nervously about the room, straightening chairs, patting her tight short curls into place.</p>

    <p>"Oh George I thought you werent comin. . . . How do you do Mr. McNiel? I dunno why I'm all jumpy today. I thought you were never comin. Let's get some lunch up. I'm that hungry."</p>



    <p>George Baldwin put his derby hat and stick on a table in the corner. "What'll you have Gus?" he said. "Sure I always take a lamb chop an a baked potato."</p>

    <p>"I'm just taking crackers and milk, my stomach's a little out of order. . . . Nevada see if you cant frisk up a highball for Mr. McNiel."</p>

    <p>"Well I could do with a highball George."</p>

    <p>"George order me half a broiled chicken lobster and some alligator pear salad," screeched Nevada from the bathroom where she was cracking ice.</p>

    <p>"She's the greatest girl for lobster," said Baldwin laughing as he went to the phone.</p>

    <p>She came back from the bathroom with two highballs on a tray; she had put a scarlet and parrotgreen batik scarf round her neck. "Just you an me's drinkin Mr. McNiel. . . . George is on the water wagon. Doctor's orders."</p>

    <p>"Nevada what do you say we go to a musical show this afternoon? There's a lot of business I want to get off my mind."</p>

    <p>"I just love matinees. Do you mind if we take Tony Hunter. He called up he was lonesome and wanted to come round this afternoon. He's not workin this week."</p>

    <p>"All right. . . . Nevada will you excuse us if we talk business for just a second over here by the window. We'll forget it by the time lunch comes."</p>

    <p>"All righty I'll change my dress."</p>

    <p>"Sit down here Gus."</p>

    <p>They sat silent a moment looking out of the window at the red girder cage of the building under construction next door. "Well Gus," said Baldwin suddenly harshly, "I'm in the race."</p>

    <p>"Good for you George, we need men like you."</p>

    <p>"I'm going to run on a Reform ticket."</p>

    <p>"The hell you are?"</p>

    <p>"I wanted to tell you Gus rather than have you hear it by a roundabout way."</p>

    <p>"Who's goin to elect you?"</p>

    <p>"Oh I've got my backing. . . . I'll have a good press."</p>



    <p>"Press hell. . . . We've got the voters. . . . But Goddam it if it hadn't been for me your name never would have come up for district attorney at all."</p>

    <p>"I know you've always been a good friend of mine and I hope you'll continue to be."</p>

    <p>"I never went back on a guy yet, but Jez, George, it's give and take in this world."</p>

    <p>"Well," broke in Nevada advancing towards them with little dancesteps, wearing a flamingo pink silk dress, "havent you boys argued enough yet?"</p>

    <p>"We're through," growled Gus. ". . . Say Miss Nevada, how did you get that name?"</p>

    <p>"I was born in Reno. . . . My mother'd gone there to get a divorce. . . . Gosh she was sore. . . . Certainly put my foot in it that time."</p>

    <p>Anna Cohen stands behind the counter under the sign The Best Sandwich in New York. Her feet ache in her pointed shoes with runover heels.</p>

    <p>"Well I guess they'll begin soon or else we're in for a slack day," says the sodashaker beside her. He's a raw-faced man with a sharp adamsapple. "It allus comes all of a rush like."</p>

    <p>"Yeh, looks like they all got the same idear at the same time." They stand looking out through the glass partition at the endless files of people jostling in and out of the subway. All at once she slips away from the counter and back into the stuffy kitchenette where a stout elderly woman is tidying up the stove. There is a mirror hanging on a nail in the corner. Anna fetches a powderbox from the pocket of her coat on the rack and starts powdering her nose. She stands a second with the tiny puff poised looking at her broad face with the bangs across the forehead and the straight black bobbed hair. A homely lookin kike, she says to herself bitterly. She is slipping back to her place at the counter when she runs into the manager, a little fat Italian with a greasy bald head. "Cant you do nutten but primp an look in de glass all day? . . . Veree good you're fired."</p>

    <p>She stares at his face sleek like an olive. "Kin I stay out my day?" she stammers. He nods. "Getta move on; this aint no beauty parlor." She hustles back to her place at the counter. The stools are all full. Girls, officeboys, grayfaced bookkeepers. "Chicken sandwich and a cup o caufee." "Cream cheese and olive sandwich and a glass of buttermilk."</p>

    <p>"Chocolate sundae."</p>

    <p>"Egg sandwich, coffee and doughnuts." "Cup of bouillon." "Chicken broth." "Chocolate icecream soda." People eat hurriedly without looking at each other, with their eyes on their plates, in their cups. Behind the people sitting on stools those waiting nudge nearer. Some eat standing up. Some turn their backs on the counter and eat looking out through the glass partition and the sign hcnuL eniL neerG at the jostling crowds filing in and out the subway through the drabgreen gloom.</p>

    <p>"Well Joey tell me all about it," said Gus McNiel puffing a great cloud of smoke out of his cigar and leaning back in his swivel chair. "What are you guys up to over there in Flatbush?"</p>

    <p>O'Keefe cleared his throat and shuffled his feet. "Well sir we got an agitation committee."</p>

    <p>"I should say you had. . . . That aint no reason for raidin the Garment Workers' ball is it?"</p>

    <p>"I didn't have nothin to do with that. . . . The bunch got sore at all these pacifists and reds."</p>

    <p>"That stuff was all right a year ago, but public sentiment's changin. I tell you Joe the people of this country are pretty well fed up with war heroes."</p>

    <p>"We got a livewire organization over there."</p>

    <p>"I know you have Joe. I know you have. Trust you for that. . . . I'd put the soft pedal on the bonus stuff though. . . . The State of New York's done its duty by the ex-service man."</p>

    <p>"That's true enough."</p>

    <p>"A national bonus means taxes to the average business man and nothing else. . . . Nobody wants no more taxes."</p>

    <p>"Still I think the boys have got it comin to em."</p>

    <p>"We've all of us got a whole lot comin to us we dont never get. . . . For crissake dont quote me on this. . . . Joey fetch yourself a cigar from that box over there. Frien o mine sent em up from Havana by a naval officer."</p>

    <p>"Thankye sir."</p>

    <p>"Go ahead take four or five."</p>

    <p>"Jez thank you."</p>

    <p>"Say Joey how'll you boys line up on the mayoralty election?"</p>

    <p>"That depends on the general attitude towards the needs of the ex-service man."</p>

    <p>"Look here Joey you're a smart feller . . ."</p>

    <p>"Oh they'll line up all right. I kin talk em around."</p>

    <p>"How many guys have you got over there?"</p>

    <p>"The Sheamus O'Rielly Post's got three hundred members an new ones signin up every day. . . . We're gettin em from all over. We're goin to have a Christmas dance an some fights in the Armory if we can get hold of any pugs."</p>

    <p>Gus McNiel threw back his head on his bullneck and laughed. "Thataboy!"</p>

    <p>"But honest the bonus is the only way we kin keep the boys together."</p>

    <p>"Suppose I come over and talk to em some night."</p>

    <p>"That'd be all right, but they're dead sot against anybody who aint got a war record."</p>

    <p>McNiel flushed. "Come back feeling kinder smart, dont ye, you guys from overseas?" He laughed. "That wont last more'n a year or two. . . . I seen em come back from the Spanish American War, remember that Joe."</p>

    <p>An officeboy came in an laid a card on the desk. "A lady to see you Mr. McNiel."</p>

    <p>"All right show her in. . . . It's that old bitch from the school board. . . . All right Joe, drop in again next week. . . . I'll keep you in mind, you and your army."</p>

    <p>Dougan was waiting in the outer office. He sidled up mysteriously. "Well Joe, how's things?"</p>

    <p>"Pretty good," said Joe puffing out his chest. "Gus tells me Tammany'll be right behind us in our drive for the bonus . . . planning a nation wide campaign. He gave me some cigars a friend o his brought up by airplane from Havana. . . . Have one?" With their cigars tilting up out of the corners of their mouths they walked briskly cockily across City Hall square. Opposite the old City Hall there was a scaffolding. Joe pointed at it with his cigar. "That there's the new statue of Civic Virtue the mayor's havin set up."</p>

    <p>The steam of cooking wrenched at his knotted stomach as he passed Child's. Dawn was sifting fine gray dust over the black ironcast city. Dutch Robertson despondently crossed Union Square, remembering Francie's warm bed, the spicy smell of her hair. He pushed his hands deep in his empty pockets. Not a red, and Francie couldn't give him anything. He walked east past the hotel on Fifteenth. A colored man was sweeping off the steps. Dutch looked at him enviously; he's got a job. Milk wagons jingled by. On Stuyvesant Square a milkman brushed past him with a bottle in each hand. Dutch stuck out his jaw and talked tough. "Give us a swig o milk will yez?" The milkman was a frail pinkfaced youngster. His blue eyes wilted. "Sure go round behind the wagon, there's an open bottle under the seat. Dont let nobody see you drink it." He drank it in deep gulps, sweet and soothing to his parched throat. Jez I ddin't need to talk rough like that. He waited until the boy came back. "Thankye buddy, that was mighty white."</p>

    <p>He walked into the chilly park and sat down on a bench. There was hoarfrost on the asphalt. He picked up a torn piece of pink evening newspaper. $500,000 Holdup. Bank Messenger Robbed in Wall Street Rush Hour.</p>

    <p>In the busiest part of the noon hour two men held up Adolphus St. John, a bank messenger for the Guarantee Trust Company, and snatched from his hands a satchel containing a half a million dollars in bills . . .</p>

    <p>Dutch felt his heart pounding as he read the column. He was cold all over. He got to his feet and began thrashing his arms about.</p>

    <p>Congo stumped through the turnstile at the end of the L line.

    <p>"How you like, Meester 'Erf?"</p>

    <p>"Fine Congo. Is that water?"</p>

    <p>"That Sheepshead Bay."</p>

    <p>They walked along the road, dodging an occasional blue-steel glint of a puddle. The arclights had a look of shrunken grapes swaying in the wind. To the right and left were flickering patches of houses in the distance. They stopped at a long building propped on piles over the water. Pool;

        </persName>
        </person> barely made out the letters on an unlighted window. The door opened as they reached it. "Hello Mike," said Congo. "This is Meester 'Erf, a frien' o mine." The door closed behind them. Inside it was black as an oven. A calloused hand grabbed 
        <person key="JimmyHerf">
            <persName>

            </person>'s hand in the dark.</p>

    <p>"Glad to meet you," said a voice.</p>

    <p>"Say how did you find my hand?"</p>

    <p>"Oh I kin see in the dark." The voice laughed throatily.</p>

    <p>By that time Congo had opened the inner door. Light streamed through picking out billiard tables, a long bar at the end, racks of cues. "This is Mike Cardinale," said Congo. 
        <person key="JimmyHerf">
        <persName>
            <forename>Jimmy</forename>
        </persName>
        </person> found himself standing beside a tall sallow shylooking man with bunchy black hair growing low on his forehead. In the inner room were shelves full of chinaware and a round table covered by a piece of mustardcolored oilcloth. "Eh la patronne," shouted Congo. A fat Frenchwoman with red applecheeks came out through the further door; behind her came a chiff of sizzling butter and garlic. "This is frien o mine. . . . Now maybe we eat," shouted Congo. "She my wife," said Cardinale proudly. "Very deaf. . . . Have to talk loud." He turned and closed the door to the large hall carefully and bolted it. "No see lights from road," he said. "In summer," said Mrs. Cardinale, "sometime we give a hundred meals a day, or a hundred an fifty maybe."</p>

    <p>"Havent you got a little peekmeup?" said Congo. He let himself down with a grunt into a chair.</p>

    <p>Cardinale set a fat fiasco of wine on the table and some glasses. They tasted it smacking their lips. "Bettern Dago Red, eh Meester 'Erf?"</p>

    <p>"It sure is. Tastes like real Chianti."</p>

    <p>Mrs. Cardinale set six plates with a stained fork, knife, and spoon in each and then put a steaming tureen of soup in the middle of the table.</p>

    <p>"Pronto pasta," she shrieked in a guineahen voice.</p>

    <p>"Thisa Anetta," said Cardinale as a pinkcheeked blackhaired girl with long lashes curving back from bright black eyes ran into the room followed by a heavily tanned young man in khaki overalls with curly sunbleached hair. They all sat down at once and began to eat the peppery thick vegetable chowder, leaning far over their plates.</p>

    <p>When Congo had finished his soup he looked up. "Mike did you see lights?" Cardinale nodded. "Sure ting . . . be here any time." While they were eating a dish of fried eggs and garlic, frizzled veal cutlets with fried potatoes and broccoli, Herf began to hear in the distance the pop pop pop of a motorboat. Congo got up from the table with a motion to them to be quiet and looked out the window, cautiously lifting a corner of the shade, "That him," he said as he stumped back to the table. "We eat good here, eh Meester Erf?"</p>

    <p>The young-man got to his feet wiping his mouth on his forearm. "Got a nickel Congo," he said doing a double shuffle with his sneakered feet. "Here go Johnny." The girl followed him out into the dark outer room. In a moment a mechanical piano started tinkling out a waltz. Through the door

            <forename>Jimmy</forename>
        </persName>
        </person> could see them dancing in and out of the oblong of light. The chugging of the motorboat drew nearer. Congo went out, then Cardinale and his wife, until

            </person> was left alone sipping a glass of wine among the debris of the dinner. He felt excited and puzzled and a little drunk. Already he began to construct the story in his mind. From the road came the grind of gears of a truck, then of another. The motorboat engine choked, backfired and stopped. There was the creak of a boat against the piles, a swash of waves and silence. The mechanical piano had stopped. 
            <person key="JimmyHerf">

                </person> sat sipping his wine. He could smell the rankness of salt marshes seeping into the house. Under him there was a little lapping sound of the water against the piles. Another motorboat was beginning to sputter in the far distance.</p>

    <p>"Got a nickel?" asked Congo breaking into the room suddenly. "Make music. . . . Very funny night tonight. Maybe you and Annette keep piano goin. I didnt see McGee about landin. . . . Maybe somebody come. Must be veree quick." <

Outside were voices and footsteps. "Please," she said all at once and they stopped dancing. The second motorboat had come very near; the motor coughed and rattled still. "Please stay here," she said and slipped away from him.</p>

In a lonely abandoned dancehall on Sheepshead Bay . . . lovely blooming Italian girl . . . shrill whistle in the dark. . . . I ought to get out and see what's going on. He groped for the front door. It was locked. He walked over to the piano and put another nickel in. Then he lit a fresh cigarette and started walking up and down again. Always the way . . . a parasite on the drama of life, reporter looks at everything through a peephole. Never mixes in. The piano was playing Yes We Have No Bananas. "Oh hell!" he kept muttering and ground his teeth and walked up and down.</p>

    <p>Outside the tramp of steps broke into a scuffle, voices snarled. There was a splintering of wood and the crash of breaking bottles.

    <p>"Goddam . . . dey break my leg," he shouted.</p>

    <p>"Good God."

    <p>"Cost me feefty dollars to have it mended last time I busted it."</p>

    <p>"You mean your cork leg?"</p>

    <p>"Sure what you tink?"</p>

    <p>"Is it prohibition agents?"</p>

    <p>"Prohibition agents nutten, goddam hijackers. . . . Go put a neeckel in the piano." Beautiful Girl of My Dreams, the piano responded gayly.</p>

"Regardez moi ça . . . c'est foutu . . . completement foutu." As he spoke Cardinale came in. He had a deep gash over his eyes from which a trickle of blood ran down his cheek on his coat and shirt. His wife followed him rolling back her eyes; she had a basin and a sponge with which she kept making ineffectual dabs at his forehead. He pushed her away. "I crowned one of em good wid a piece o pipe. I think he fell in de water. God I hope he drownded," Johnny came in holding his head high. Annette had her arm round his waist. He had a black eye and one of the sleeves of his shirt hung in shreds. "Gee it was like in the movies," said Annette, giggling hysterically. "Wasnt he grand, mommer, wasn't he grand?"</p>

    <p>"Jez it's lucky they didn't start shootin; one of em had a gun."</p>

    <p>"Scared to I guess."</p>

    <p>"Trucks are off."</p>

    <p>"Just one case got busted up. . . . God there was five of them."</p>

    <p>"Gee didnt he mix it up with em?" screamed Annette.</p>

    <p>"Oh shut up," growled Cardinale. He had dropped into a chair and his wife was sponging off his face. "Did you get a good look at the boat?" asked Congo.</p>

    <p>"Too goddam dark," said Johnny. "Fellers talked like they came from Joisey. . . . First ting I knowed one of em comes up to me and sez I'm a revenue officer an I pokes him one before he has time to pull a gun an overboard he goes. Jez they were yeller. That guy George on the boat near brained one of em wid an oar. Then they got back in their old teakettle an beat it."</p>

    <p>"But how they know how we make landin?" stuttered Congo his face purple.</p>

    <p>"Some guy blabbed maybe," said Cardinale. "If I find out who it is, by God I'll . . ." he made a popping noise with his lips.</p>

    <p>"You see Meester 'Erf," said Congo in his suave voice again, "it was all champagne for the holidays. . . . Very valuable cargo eh?" Annette, her cheeks very red sat still looking at Johnny with parted lips and toobright eyes. Herf found himself blushing as he looked at her.</p>

    <p>He got to his feet. "Well I must be getting back to the big city. Thank's for the feed and the melodrama, Congo."</p>

    <p>"You find station all right?"</p>

    <p>"Sure."</p>

    <p>"Goodnight Meester 'Erf, maybe you buy case of champagne for Christmas, genuine Mumms."</p>



    <p>"Too darn broke Congo."</p>

    <p>"Then maybe you sell to your friends an I give you commission."</p>

    <p>"All right I'll see what I can do."</p>

    <p>"I'll phone you tomorrow to tell price."</p>

    <p>"That's a fine idea. Good night."</p>

The girl's pink cheeks and toobright eyes kept intervening, blurring the orderly arrangement of his thoughts. He sank gradually into dreamier and dreamier reverie. Before the kid was born Ellie sometimes had toobright eyes like that. The time on the hill when she had suddenly wilted in his arms and been sick and he had left her among the munching, calmly staring cows on the grassy slope and gone to a shepherd's hut and brought back milk in a wooden ladle, and slowly as the mountains hunched up with evening the color had come back into her cheeks and she had looked at him that way and said with a dry little laugh: It's the little Herf inside me. God why cant I stop mooning over things that are past And when the baby was coming and Ellie was in the American Hospital at Neuilly, himself wandering distractedly through the fair, going into the Flea Circus, riding on merrygorounds and the steam swing, buying toys, candy, taking chances on dolls in a crazy blur, stumbling back to the hospital with a big plaster pig under his arm. Funny these fits of refuge in the past. Suppose she had died; I thought she would. The past would have been complete all round, framed, worn round your neck like a cameo, set up in type, molded on plates for the Magazine Section, like the first of

    <p>At midnight he was walking across Fourteenth. He didnt want to go home to bed although the rasping cold wind tore at his neck and chin with sharp ice claws. He walked west across Seventh and Eighth Avenues, found the name Roy Sheffield beside a bell in a dimly lit hall. As soon as he pressed the bell the catch on the door began to click. He ran up the stairs. Roy had his big curly head with its glass gray gollywog eyes stuck out the door.</p>

    <p>"By the way," asked Roy, "where's Helena."</p>

    <p>"Dent interrupt Roy," said Alice. "This is good . . . and besides you should never ask a man where his wife is."</p>

    <p>"Then there was a lot of flashing of signal lights and stuff and a motorboat loaded down with Mumm's extra dry champagne for Park Avenue Christmases came in and the hijackers arrived on a speedboat. . . . It probably was a hydroplane it came so fast . . ."</p>

    <p>"My this is exciting," cooed Alice. ". . . Roy why dont you take up bootlegging?"</p>

    <p>"Worst fight I ever saw outside of the movies, six or seven on a side all slugging each other on a little narrow landing the size of this room, people crowning each other with oars and joints of lead pipe."</p>

    <p>"Was anybody hurt?"</p>

    <p>"Everybody was. . . . I think two of the hijackers were drowned. At any rate they beat a retreat leaving us lapping up the spilled champagne."</p>

    <p>James Merivale was going over a freshly decoded cable, tapping the words with a pencil as he read them. Tasmanian Manganese Products instructs us to open credit. . . . The phone on his desk began to buzz.</p>

    <p>"James this is your mother. Come right up; something terrible has happened."</p>

    <p>"But I dont know if I can get away. . . ."</p>

    <p>She had already cut off. Merivale felt himself turning pale. "Let me speak to Mr. Aspinwall please. . . . Mr. Aspinwall this is Merivale. . . . My mother's been taken suddenly ill. I'm afraid it may be a stroke. I'd like to run up there for an hour. I'll be back in time to get a cable off on that Tasmanian matter."</p>

    <p>"All right. . . . I'm very sorry Merivale."</p>

    <p>He grabbed his hat and coat, forgetting his muffler, and streaked out of the bank and along the street to the subway. He burst into the apartment breathless, snapping his fingers from nervousness. Mrs. Merivale grayfaced met him in the hall.</p>

    <p>"My dear I thought you'd been taken ill."</p>

    <p>"It's not that . . . it's about Maisie."</p>

    <p>"She hasnt met with an accid. . .?"</p>

    <p>"Come in here," interrupted Mrs. Merivale. In the parlor sat a little roundfaced woman in a round mink hat and a long mink coat. "My dear this girl says she's Mrs. Jack Cunningham and she's got a marriage certificate to prove it."</p>

    <p>"Good Heavens, is that true?"</p>

    <p>The girl nodded in a melancholy way.</p>

    <p>"And the invitations are out. Since his last wire Maisie's been ordering her trousseau."</p>

    <p>The girl unfolded a large certificate ornamented with pansies and cupids and handed it to James.</p>

    <p>"It might be forged."</p>

    <p>"It's not forged," said the girl sweetly.</p>

    <p>"John. C. Cunningham, 21 . . . Jessie Lincoln, 18," he read aloud. . . . "I'll smash his face for that, the blackguard. That's certainly his signature, I've seen it at the bank. . . . The blackguard."</p>

    <p>"Now James, don't be hasty."</p>

    <p>"I thought it would be better this way than after the ceremony," put in the girl in her little sugar voice. "I wouldnt have Jack commit bigamy for anything in the world."</p>

    <p>"Where's Maisie?"</p>

    <p>"The poor darling is prostrated in her room."</p>

    <p>Merivale's face was crimson. The sweat itched under his collar. "Now dearest" Mrs. Merivale kept saying, "you must promise me not to do anything rash."</p>

    <p>"Yes Maisie's reputation must be protected at all costs."</p>

    <p>"My dear I think the best thing to do is to get him up here and confront him with this . . . with this . . . lady. . . . Would you agree to that Mrs. Cunningham?"</p>

    <p>"Oh dear. . . . Yes I suppose so."</p>

    <p>"Wait a minute," shouted Merivale and strode down the hall to the telephone. "Rector 12305. . . . Hello. I want to speak to Mr. Jack Cunningham please. . . . Hello. Is this Mr. Cunningham's office? Mr. James Merivale speaking. . . . Out of town. . . . And when will he be back? . . . Hum," He strode back along the hall. "The damn scoundrel's out of town."</p>

    <p>"All the years I've known him," said the little lady in the round hat, "that has always been where he was."</p>

    <p>Outside the broad office windows the night is gray and foggy. Here and there a few lights make up dim horizontals and perpendiculars of asterisks. Phineas Blackhead sits at his desk tipping far back in the small leather armchair. In his hand protecting his fingers by a large silk handkerchief, he holds a glass of hot water and bicarbonate of soda. Densch bald and round as a billiardball sits in the deep armchair playing with his tortoiseshell spectacles. Everything is quiet except for an occasional rattling and snapping of the steampipes.</p>

    <p>"Densch you must forgive me. . . . You know I rarely permit myself an observation concerning other people's business," Blackhead is saying slowly between sips; then suddenly he sits up in his chair. "It's a damn fool proposition, Densch, by God it is . . . by the Living Jingo it's ridiculous."</p>

    <p>"I dont like dirtying my hands any more than you do. . . . Baldwin's a good fellow, I think we're safe in backing him a little."</p>

    <p>"What the hell's an import and export firm got to do in politics? If any of those guys wants a handout let him come up here and get it. Our business is the price of beans . . . and its goddam low. If any of you puling lawyers could restore the balance of the exchanges I'd be willing to do anything in the world. . . . They're crooks every last goddam one of em . . . by the Living Jingo they're crooks." His face flushes purple, he sits upright in his chair banging with his fist on the corner of the desk. "Now you're getting me all excited. . . . Bad for my stomach, bad for my heart." Phineas Blackhead belches portentously and takes a great gulp out of the glass of bicarbonate of soda. Then he leans back in his chair again letting his heavy lids half cover his eyes.</p>

    <p>"Well old man," says Mr. Densch in a tired voice, "it may have been a bad thing to do, but I've promised to support the reform candidate. That's a purely private matter in no way involving the firm."</p>

    <p>"Like hell it dont. . . . How about McNiel and his gang? . . . They've always treated us all right and all we've ever done for em's a couple of cases of Scotch and a few cigars now and then. . . . Now we have these reformers throw the whole city government into a turmoil. . . . By the Living Jingo . . ."</p>

    <p>Densch gets to his feet. "My dear Blackhead I consider it my duty as a citizen to help in cleaning up the filthy conditions of bribery, corruption and intrigue that exist in the city government . . . I consider it my duty as a citizen . . ." He starts walking to the door, his round belly stuck proudly out in front of him.</p>

    <p>"Well allow me to say Densch that I think its a damn fool proposition," Blackhead shouts after him. When his partner has gone he lies back a second with his eyes closed. His face takes on the mottled color of ashes, his big fleshy frame is shrinking like a deflating balloon. At length he gets to his feet with a groan. Then he takes his hat and coat and walks out of the office with a slow heavy step. The hall is empty and dimly lit. He has to wait a long while for the elevator. The thought of holdup men sneaking through the empty building suddenly makes him catch his breath. He is afraid to look behind him, like a child in the dark. At last the elevator shoots up.</p>

    <p>"Wilmer," he says to the night watchman who runs it, "there ought to be more light in these halls at night. . . . During this crime wave I should think you ought to keep the building brightly lit."</p>

    <p>"Yassir maybe you're right sir . . . but there cant nobody get in unless I sees em first."</p>

    <p>"You might be overpowered by a gang Wilmer."</p>

    <p>"I'd like to see em try it."</p>

    <p>"I guess you are right . . . mere question of nerve."</p>

    <p>Cynthia is sitting in the Packard reading a book. "Well dear did you think I was never coming."</p>

    <p>"I almost finished my book, dad."</p>

    <p>"All right Butler . . . up town as fast as you can. We're late for dinner."</p>

    <p>As the limousine whirs up Lafayette Street, Blackhead turns to his daughter. "If you ever hear a man talking about his duty as a citizen, by the Living Jingo dont trust him. . . . He's up to some kind of monkey business nine times out of ten. You dont know what a relief it is to me that you and Joe are comfortably settled in life."</p>

    <p>"What's the matter dad? Did you have a hard day at the office?" "There are no markets, there isnt a market in the goddam world that isnt shot to blazes. . . . I tell you Cynthia it's nip and tuck. There's no telling what might happen. . . . Look, before I forget it could you be at the bank uptown at twelve tomorrow? . . . I'm sending Hudgins up with certain securities, personal you understand, I want to put in your safe deposit box."</p>

    <p>"But it's jammed full already dad."</p>

    <p>"That box at the Astor Trust is in your name isnt it?"</p>

    <p>"Jointly in mine and Joe's."</p>

    <p>"Well you take a new box at the Fifth Avenue Bank in your own name. . . . I'll have the stuff get there at noon sharp. . . . And remember what I tell you Cynthia, if you ever hear a business associate talking about civic virtue, look lively."</p>

    <p>They are crossing Fourteenth. Father and daughter look out through the glass at the windbitten faces of people waiting to cross the street.</p>

He pushed open the sliding doors a little and peeped into the cold bedroom. He could barely make out Ellie asleep in the bed in the alcove. At the far end of the room was the baby's crib. There was a faint milkish sour smell of babyclothes. He pushed the doors to again and began to undress. If we only had more space, he was muttering; we live cramped in our squirrelcage. . . . He pulled the dusty cashmere off the couch and yanked his pyjamas out from under the pillow. Space space cleanness quiet; the words were gesticulating in his mind as if he were addressing a vast auditorium.</p>

    <p>He turned out the light, opened a crack of the window and dropped wooden with sleep into bed. Immediately he was writing a letter on a linotype. Now I lay me down to sleep . . . mother of the great white twilight. The arm of the linotype was a woman's hand in a long white glove.

He pulled the covers about him and settled to sleep again. The next time he woke up it was daylight. He was warm and happy. Snowflakes were dancing, hesitating, spinning, outside the tall window.</p>

    <p>"Oh you're marvelous Ellie. . . . Wait a minute I must jump up and wash my teeth." He came back with his face washed, wearing his bathrobe. Her mouth winced under his kiss. "And it's only eleven o'clock. I've gained an hour on my day off. . . . Wont you have some coffee too?"</p>

    <p>"But Ellie we'd never see each other. . . . We hardly ever see each other as it is."</p>

    <p>"It's terrible . . . but what can we do when our office-hours are so different?"</p>

An impulse to grab her hands to crush her to him until he hurt her went up through him like a rocket and died. She picked up the coffeethings and swished away. His lips knew her lips, his arms knew the twining of her arms, he knew the deep woods of her hair, he loved her. He sat for a long time looking at his feet, lanky reddish feet with swollen blue veins, shoebound toes twisted by stairs and pavements. On each little toe there was a corn. He found his eyes filling with pitying tears. The baby had stopped crying.

    <p>They are walking slowly up Second Avenue through a foggy evening. He is a rustyhaired thinfaced young Jew with sunken cheeks and livid pale skin. He has the bandy legs of a garment worker. Anna's shoes are too small for her. She has deep rings under her eyes. The fog is full of strolling groups talking Yiddish, overaccented East Side English, Russian. Warm rifts of light from delicatessen stores and softdrink stands mark off the glistening pavement.</p>

    <p>"If I didn't feel so tired all the time," mutters Anna.</p>

    <p>"Let's stop here an have a drink. . . . You take a glass o buttermilk Anna, make ye feel good."</p>

    <p>"I aint got the taste for it Elmer. I'll take a chocolate soda."</p>

    <p>"That'll juss make ye feel sick, but go ahead if you wanter." She sat on the slender nickelbound stool. He stood beside her. She let herself lean back a little against him. "The trouble with the workers is" . . . He was talking in a low impersonal voice. "The trouble with the workers is we dont know nothin, we dont know how to eat, we dont know how to live, we dont know how to protect our rights. . . . Jez Anna I want to make you think of things like that. Cant you see we're in the middle of a battle just like in the war?" With the long sticky spoon Anna was fishing bits of icecream out of the thick foamy liquid in her glass.</p>



    <p>George Baldwin looked at himself in the mirror as he washed his hands in the Httle washroom behind his office. His hair that still grew densely down to a point on his forehead was almost white. There was a deep line at each corner of his mouth and across his chin. Under his bright gimleteyes the skin was sagging and granulated. When he had wiped his hands slowly and meticulously he took a little box of strychnine pills from the upper pocket of his vest, swallowed one, and feeling the anticipated stimulus tingle through him went back into his office. A longnecked officeboy was fidgeting beside his desk with a card in his hand.</p>

    <p>"A lady wants to speak to you sir."</p>

    <p>"Has she an appointment? Ask Miss Ranke. . . . Wait a minute. Show the lady right through into this office."</p>

    <p>The card read Nellie Linihan McNiel. She was expensively dressed with a lot of lace in the opening of her big fur coat. Round her neck she had a lorgnette on an amethyst chain.</p>

    <p>"Gus asked me to come to see you," she said as he motioned her into a chair beside the desk.</p>

    <p>"What can I do for you?" His heart for some reason was pounding hard.</p>

    <p>She looked at him a moment through her lorgnette. "George you stand it better than Gus does."</p>

    <p>"What?"</p>

    <p>"Oh all this. . . . I'm trying to get Gus to go away with me for a rest abroad . . . Marianbad or something like that . . . but he says he's in too deep to pull up his stakes."</p>

    <p>"I guess that's true of all of us," said Baldwin with a cold smile.</p>

    <p>They were silent a minute, then Nellie McNiel got to her feet. "Look here George, Gus is awfully cut up about this. . . . You know he likes to stand by his friends and have his friends stand by him."</p>

    <p>"Nobody can say that I havent stood by him. . . . It's simply this, I'm not a politician, and as, probably foolishly, I've allowed myself to be nominated for office, I have to run on a nonpartisan basis."</p>

    <p>"George that's only half the story and you know it."</p>



    <p>"Tell him that I've always been and always shall be a good friend of his. . . . He knows that perfectly well. In this particular campaign I have pledged myself to oppose certain elements with which Gus has let himself get involved."</p>

    <p>"You're a fine talker George Baldwin and you always were."</p>

    <p>Baldwin flushed. They stood stiff side by side at the office door. His hand lay still on the doorknob as if paralyzed. From the outer offices came the sound of typewriters and voices. From outside came the long continuous tapping of riveters at work on a new building.</p>

    <p>"I hope your family's all well," he said at length with an effort.</p>

    <p>"Oh yes they are all well thanks . . . Goodby." She had gone.</p>

    <p>Baldwin stood for a moment looking out of the window at the gray blackwindowed building opposite. Silly to let things agitate him so. Need of relaxation. He got his hat and coat from their hook behind the washroom door and went out.</p>

    <p>"Jonas," he said to a man with a round bald head shaped like a cantaloupe who sat poring over papers in the highceilinged library that was the central hall of the lawoffice, "bring everything up that's on my desk. . . . I'll go over it uptown tonight."</p>

    <p>"All right sir."</p>

    <p>When he got out on Broadway he felt like a small boy playing hooky. It was a sparkling winter afternoon with hurrying rifts of sun and cloud. He jumped into a taxi. Going uptown he lay back in the seat dozing. At Forty-second Street he woke up. Everything was a confusion of bright intersecting planes of color, faces, legs, shop windows, trolleycars, automobiles. He sat up with his gloved hands on his knees, fizzling with excitement. Outside of Nevada's apartmenthouse he paid the taxi. The driver was a negro and showed an ivory mouthful of teeth when he got a fifty-cent tip. Neither elevator was there so Baldwin ran lightly up the stairs, half wondering at himself. He knocked on Nevada's door. No answer. He knocked again. She opened it cautiously. He could see her curly towhead. He brushed into the room before she could stop him. All she had on was a kimono over a pink chemise.</p>

    <p>"My God," she said, "I thought you were the waiter."</p>

    <p>He grabbed her and kissed her. "I dont know why but I feel like a threeyear old."</p>

    <p>"You look like you was crazy with the heat. . . . I dont like you to come over without telephoning, you know that."</p>

    <p>"You dont mind just this once I forgot."</p>

    <p>Baldwin caught sight of something on the settee; he found himself staring at a pair of darkblue trousers neatly folded.</p>

    <p>"I was feeling awfully fagged down at the office Nevada. I thought I'd come up to talk to you to cheer myself up a bit."</p>

    <p>"I was just practicing some dancing with the phonograph."</p>

    <p>"Yes very interesting. . . ." He began to walk springily up and down. "Now look here Nevada. . . . We've got to have a talk. I dont care who it is you've got in your bedroom." She looked suddenly in his face and sat down on the settee beside the trousers. "In fact I've known for some time that you and Tony Hunter were carrying on." She compressed her lips and crossed her legs. "In fact all this stuff and nonsense about his having to go to a psychoanalyst at twentyfive dollars an hour amused me enormously. . . . But just this minute I've decided I had enough. Quite enough."</p>

    <p>"George you're crazy," she stammered and then suddenly she began to giggle.</p>

    <p>"I tell you what I'll do," went on Baldwin in a clear legal voice, "I'll send you a check for five hundred, because you're a nice girl and I like you. The apartment's paid till the first of the month. Does that suit you? And please never communicate with me in any way."</p>

    <p>She was rolling on the settee giggling helplessly beside the neatly folded pair of darkblue trousers. Baldwin waved his hat and gloves at her and left closing the door very gently behind him. Good riddance, he said to himself as he closed the door carefully behind him.</p>

    <p>Down in the street again he began to walk briskly uptown. He felt excited and talkative. He wondered who he could go to see. Telling over the names of his friends made him depressed. He began to feel lonely, deserted. He wanted to be talking to a woman, making her sorry for the barrenness of his life. He went into a cigarstore and began looking through the phonebook. There was a faint flutter in him when he found the H's. At last he found the name Herf, Helena Oglethorpe.</p>

    <p>Nevada Jones sat a long while on the settee giggling hysterically. At length Tony Hunter came in in his shirt and drawers with his bow necktie perfectly tied.</p>

    <p>"Has he gone?"</p>

    <p>"Gone? sure he's gone, gone for good," she shrieked. "He saw your damn pants."</p>

    <p>He let himself drop on a chair. "O God if I'm not the unluckiest fellow in the world."</p>

    <p>"Why?" she sat spluttering with laughter with the tears running down her face.</p>

    <p>"Nothing goes right. That means it's all off about the matinees."</p>

    <p>"It's back to three a day for little Nevada. . . . I dont give a damn. . . . I never did like bein a kept woman."</p>

    <p>"But you're not thinking of my career. . . . Women are so selfish. If you hadn't led me on. . . ."</p>

    <p>"Shut up you little fool. Dont you think I dont know all about you?" She got to her feet with the kimono pulled tight about her.</p>

    <p>"God all I needed was a chance to show what I could do, and now I'll never get it," Tony was groaning.</p>

    <p>"Sure you will if you do what I tell you. I set out to make a man of you kiddo and I'm goin to do it. . . . We'll get up an act. Old Hirshbein'll give us a chance, he used to be kinder smitten. . . . Come on now, I'll punch you in the jaw if you dont. Let's start thinkin up. . . . We'll come in with a dance number see . . . then you'll pretend to want to pick me up. . . . I'll be waitin for a streetcar . . . see . . . and you'll say Hello Girlie an I'll call Officer."</p>

    <p>"Is that all right for length sir," asked the fitter busily making marks on the trousers with a piece of chalk.</p>

    <p>James Merivale looked down at the fitter's little greenish wizened bald head and at the brown trousers flowing amply about his feet. "A little shorter. . . . I think it looks a little old to have trousers too long."</p>

    <p>"Why hello Merivale I didn't know you bought your clothes at Brooks' too. Gee I'm glad to see you."</p>

    <p>Merivale's blood stood still. He found himself looking straight in the blue alcoholic eyes of Jack Cunningham. He bit his lip and tried to stare at him coldly without speaking.</p>

    <p>"God Almighty, do you know what we've done?" cried out Cunningham. "We've bought the same suit of clothes. . . . I tell you it's identically the same."</p>

    <p>Merivale was looking in bewilderment from Cunningham's brown trousers to his own, the same color, the same tiny stripe of red and faint mottling of green.</p>

    <p>"Good God man two future brothersinlaw cant wear the same suit. People'll think it's a uniform. . . . It's ridiculous."</p>

    <p>"Well what are we going to do about it?" Merivale found himself saying in a grumbling tone.</p>

    <p>"We have to toss up and see who gets it that's all. . . . Will you lend me a quarter please?" Cunningham turned to his salesman. "All right. . . . One toss, you yell."</p>

    <p>"Heads," said Merivale mechanically.</p>

    <p>"The brown suit is yours. . . . Now I've got to choose another . . . God I'm glad we met when we did. Look," he shouted out through the curtains of the booth, "why dont you have dinner with me tonight at the Salmagundi Club? . . . I'm going to be dining with the only man in the world who's crazier about hydroplanes than I am. . . . It's old man Perkins, you know him, he's one of the vicepresidents of your bank. . . . And look when you see Maisie tell her I'm coming up to see her tomorrow. An extraordinary series of events has kept me from communicating with her . . . a most unfortunate series of events that took all my time up to this moment. . . . We'll talk about it later."</p>

    <p>Merivale cleared his throat. "Very well," he said dryly.</p>

    <p>"All right sir," said the fitter giving Merivale a last tap on the buttocks. He went back into the booth to dress.</p>

    <p>"All right old thing," shouted Cunningham, "I've got to go pick out another suit . . . I'll expect you at seven. I'll have a Jack Rose waiting for you."</p>

    <p>Merivale's hands were trembling as he fastened his belt. Perkins, Jack Cunningham, the damn blackguard, hydroplanes. Jack Cunningham Salmagundi Perkins. He went to a phone booth in a corner of the store and called up his mother. "Hello Mother, I'm afraid I wont be up to dinner. . . . I'm dining with Randolph Perkins at the Salmagundi Club. . . . Yes it is very pleasant. . . . Oh well he and I have always been fairly good friends. . . . Oh yes it's essential to stand in with the men higher up. And I've seen Jack Cunningham. I put it up to him straight from the shoulder man to man and he was very much embarrassed. He promised a full explanation within twentyfour hours. . . . No I kept my temper very well. I felt I owed it to Maisie. I tell you I think the man's a blackguard but until there's proof. . . . Well good night dear, in case I'm late. Oh no please dont wait up. Tell Maisie not to worry I'll be able to give her the fullest details. Good night mother."</p>

    <p>They sat at a small table in the back of a dimly lighted tearoom. The shade on the lamp cut off the upper parts of their faces. Ellen had on a dress of bright peacock blue and a small blue hat with a piece of green in it.

Oh I cant tell about it any more. . . . It isnt funny to me any more, it's just horrible. . . . Oh Elaine I'm so discouraged. My dear I'm getting old." She suddenly burst out crying.</p>

    <p>"Dear you dont understand . . . You never will understand."</p>

    <p>They sat a long while without saying anything, scraps of lowvoiced conversation came to them from other corners of the dim tearoom. The palehaired waitress brought them two orders of fruit salad.</p>

    <p>"Oh but it must be wonderful though."</p>

    <p>They rang a bell under a small brass placque that read: Hester Voorhees Interpretation of the Dance. They went up three flights of creaky freshvarnished stairs. At the door open into a room full of people they met 
        <person key="CassandraWilkins">
            <persName>

            </persName>
        </person> in a Greek tunic with a wreath of satin rosebuds round her head and a gilt wooden panpipe in her hand.</p>

    <p>"Oh you darlings," she cried and threw her arms round them both at once. "Hester said you wouldnt come but I just knew you would. . . . Come wight in and take off your things, we're beginning with a few classic wythms." They followed her through a long candlelit incensesmelling room full of men and women in dangly costumes.</p>

    <p>"But my dear you didn't tell us it was going to be a costume party."</p>

    <p>"Oh yes cant you see evewything's Gweek, absolutely Gweek. . . . Here's Hester. . . . Here they are darling. . . . Hester you know Wuth . . . and this is Elaine Oglethorpe."</p>

    <p>"Oh I beg your pardon, it's so hard to keep twack. . . . They're just in time. . . . Hester's going to dance an owiental dance called Wythms from the Awabian Nights. . . . Oh it's too beautiful."</p>

    <p>When Ellen came out of the bedroom where she had left her wraps a tall figure in Egyptian headdress with crooked rusty eyebrows accosted her. "Allow me to salute Helena Herf, distinguished editress of Manners, the journal that brings the Ritz to the humblest fireside . . . isnt that true?"</p>

    <p>"Jojo you're a horrible tease. . . . I'm awfully glad to see you."</p>

    <p>"Let's go and sit in a corner and talk, oh only woman I have ever loved. . ."</p>

    <p>"Yes do let's . . . I dont like it here much."</p>

    <p>"And my dear, have you heard about Tony Hunter's being straightened out by a psychoanalyst and now he's all sublimated and has gone on the vaudeville stage with a woman named California Jones."</p>

    <p>"You'd better watch out Jojo."</p>

    <p>They sat down on a couch in a recess between the dormer windows. Out of the corner of her eye she could see a girl dancing in green silk veils. The phonograph was playing the Cesar Frank symphony.</p>

    <p>"We mustnt miss 
        <person key="CassandraWilkins">
            <persName>
                <addName type="nickname">Cassie</addName>

        </person>'s daunce. The poor girl would be dreadfully offended."</p>

    <p>"Jojo tell me about yourself, how have you been?"</p>

    <p>He shook his head and made a broad gesture with his draped arm. "Ah let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the deaths of kings."</p>

    <p>"Oh Jojo I'm sick of this sort of thing. . . . It's all so silly and dowdy. . . . I wish I hadnt let them make me take my hat off."</p>

    <p>"That was so that I should look upon the forbidden forests of your hair."</p>

    <p>"Oh Jojo do be sensible."</p>

    <p>"How's your husband, Elaine or rathah Helenah?"</p>

    <p>"Oh he's all right."</p>

    <p>"You dont sound terribly enthusiastic."</p>

    <p>"Martin's fine though. He's got black hair and brown eyes and his cheeks are getting to be pink. Really he's awfully cute."</p>

    <p>"My deah, spare me this exhibition of maternal bliss. . . . You'll be telling me next you walked in a baby parade."</p>



    <p>She laughed. "Jojo it's lots of fun to see you again,"</p>

    <p>"I havent finished my catechism yet deah. . . . I saw you in the oval diningroom the other day with a very distinguished looking man with sharp features and gray hair."</p>

    <p>"That must have been George Baldwin. Why you knew him in the old days."</p>

    <p>"Of course of course. How he has changed. A much more interesting looking man than he used to be I must say. . . . A very strange place for the wife of a bolshevik pacifist and I. W. W. agitator to be seen taking lunch, I must say.</p>

    <p>"<person key="JimmyHerf">

        </person> isnt exactly that. I kind of wish he were. . . ." She wrinkled up her nose. "I'm a little fed up too with all that sort of thing."</p>

    <p>"I suspected it my dear." Cassia was flitting selfconsciously by.</p>

    <p>"Oh do come and help me. . . . Jojo's teasing me terribly."</p>

    <p>"Well I'll twy to sit down just for a second, I'm going to dance next. . . . Mr. Oglethorpe's going to wead his twanslation of the songs of Bilitis for me to dance to."</p>

    <p>Ellen looked from one to the other; Oglethorpe crooked his eyebrows and nodded.</p>

    <p>Then Ellen sat alone for a long while looking at the dancing and the chittering crowded room through a dim haze of boredom.</p>

    <p>The record on the phonograph was Turkish. Hester Voorhees, a skinny woman with a mop of hennaed hair cut short at the level of her ears, came out holding a pot of drawling incense out in front of her preceded by two young men who unrolled a carpet as she came. She wore silk bloomers and a clinking metal girdle and brassieres. Everybody was clapping and saying, "How wonderful, how marvelous," when from another room came three tearing shrieks of a woman. Everybody jumped to his feet. A stout man in a derby hat appeared in the doorway. "All right little goils, right through into the back room. Men stay here."</p>



    <p>"Who are you anyway?"</p>

    <p>"Never mind who I am, you do as I say." The man's face was red as a beet under the derby hat.</p>

    <p>"It's a detective." "It's outrageous. Let him show his badge."</p>

    <p>"It's a holdup."</p>

    <p>"It's a raid."</p>

    <p>The room had filled suddenly with detectives. They stood in front of the windows. A man in a checked cap with a face knobbed like a squash stood in front of the fireplace. They were pushing the women roughly into the back room. The men were herded in a little group near the door; detectives were taking their names. Ellen still sat on the couch. ". . . complaint phoned to headquarters," she heard somebody say. Then she noticed that there was a phone on the little table beside the couch where she sat. She picked it up and whispered softly for a number.</p>

    <p>"Hello is this the district attorney's office? . . . I want to speak to Mr. Baldwin please. . . . George. . . . It's lucky I knew where you were. Is the district attorney there? That's fine . . . no you tell him about it. There has been a horrible mistake. I'm at Hester Voorhees'; you know she has a dancing studio. She was presenting some dances to some friends and through some mistake the police are raiding the place . . ."</p>

    <p>The man in the derby was standing over her. "All right phoning wont do no good. . . . Go 'long in the other room."</p>

    <p>"I've got the district attorney's office on the wire. You speak to him. . . . Hello is this Mr. Winthrop? . . . Yes O . . . How do you do? Will you please speak to this man?"</p>

    <p>She handed the telephone to the detective and walked out into the center of the room. My I wish I hadnt taken my hat off, she was thinking.</p>

    <p>From the other room came a sound of sobbing and Hester Voorhees' stagy voice shrieking, "It's a horrible mistake. . . . I wont be insulted like this."</p>

    <p>The detective put down the telephone. He came over to Ellen. "I want to apologize miss. . . . We acted on insufficient information. I'll withdraw my men immediately."</p>

    <p>"You'd better apologize to Mrs. Voorhees. . . . It's her studio."</p>

    <p>"Well ladies and gents," the detective began in a loud cheerful voice, "we've made a little mistake and we're very sorry. . . . Accidents will happen . . ."</p>

    <p>Ellen slipped into the side room to get her hat and coat. She stood some time before the mirror powdering her nose. When she went out into the studio again everybody was talking at once. Men and women stood round with sheets and bathrobes draped over their scanty dancingclothes. The detectives had melted away as suddenly as they came. Oglethorpe was talking in loud impassioned tones in the middle of a group of young men.</p>

    <p>"The scoundrels to attack women," he was shouting, red in the face, waving his headdress in one hand. "Fortunately I was able to control myself or I might have committed an act that I should have regretted to my dying day. . . . It was only with the greatest selfcontrol. . ."</p>

    <p>Ellen managed to slip out, ran down the stairs and out into drizzly streets. She hailed a taxi and went home. When she had got her things off she called up George Baldwin at his house. "Hello George, I'm terribly sorry I had to trouble you and Mr. Winthrop. Well if you hadnt happened to say at lunch you'd be there all the evening they probably would be just piling us out of the black maria at the Jefferson Market Court. . . . Of course it was funny. I'll tell you about it sometime, but I'm so sick of all that stuff. . . . Oh just everything like that aesthetic dancing and literature and radicalism and psychoanalysis. . . . Just an overdose I guess. . . . Yes I guess that's it George . . . I guess I'm growing up."</p>

    <p>The night was one great chunk of black grinding cold. The smell of the presses still in his nose, the chirrup of typewriters still in his ears, <person key="JimmyHerf">

        </person> stood in City Hall Square with his hands in his pockets watching ragged men with caps and earsflaps pulled down over faces and necks the color of raw steak shovel snow. Old and young their faces were the same color, their clothes were the same color. A razor wind cut his ears and made his forehead ache between the eyes.</p>

    <p>"Hello Herf, think you'll take the job?" said a milkfaced young man who came up to him breezily and pointed to the pile of snow. "Why not, Dan. I dont know why it wouldnt be better than spending all your life rooting into other people's affairs until you're nothing but a goddam traveling dictograph."</p>

    <p>"It'd be a fine job in summer all right. . . . Taking the West Side?"</p>

    <p>"I'm going to walk up. . . . I've got the heebyjeebies tonight."</p>

    <p>"Jez man you'll freeze to death."</p>

    <p>"I dont care if I do. . . . You get so you dont have any private life, you're just an automatic writing machine."</p>

    <p>"Well I wish I could get rid of a little of my private life. . . . Well goodnight. I hope you find some private life

        </person> turned his back on the snowshovelers and started walking up Broadway, leaning into the wind with his chin buried in his coatcollar. At Houston Street he looked at his watch. Five o'clock. Gosh he was late today. Wouldnt be a place in the world where he could get a drink. He whimpered to himself at the thought of the icy blocks he still had to walk before he could get to his room. Now and then he stopped to pat some life into his numb ears. At last he got back to his room, lit the gasstove and hung over it tingling. His room was a small square bleak room on the south side of Washington Square. Its only furnishings were a bed, a chair, a table piled with books, and the gasstove. When he had begun to be a little less cold he reached under the bed for a basketcovered bottle of rum. He put some water to heat in a tin cup on the gasstove and began drinking hot rum and water. Inside him all sorts of unnamed agonies were breaking loose. He felt like the man in the fairy story with an iron band round his heart. The iron band was breaking.</p>

    <p>He had finished the rum. Occasionally the room would start going round him solemnly and methodically. Suddenly he said aloud: "I've got to talk to her . . . I've got to talk to her." He shoved his hat down on his head and pulled on his coat. Outside the cold was balmy. Six milkwagons in a row passed jingling.</p>

    <p>On West Twelfth two black cats were chasing each other. Everywhere was full of their crazy yowling. He felt that something would snap in his head, that he himself would scuttle off suddenly down the frozen street eerily caterwauling.</p>

    <p>He stood shivering in the dark passage, ringing the bell marked Herf again and again. Then he knocked as loud as he could. Ellen came to the door in a green wrapper.</p>

    <p>"What's the matter 
        <person key="JimmyHerf">
            <persName>
                <addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName>
            </persName>
        </person>? Havent you got a key?" Her face was soft with sleep; there was a happy cozy suave smell of sleep about her. He talked through clenched teeth breathlessly.</p>

    <p>"Ellie I've got to talk to you."</p>

    <p>"Are you lit, 
        <person key="JimmyHerf">
            <persName>
                <addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName>
            </persName>
        </person>?"</p>

    <p>"Well I know what I'm saying."</p>

    <p>"I'm terribly sleepy."</p>

    <p>He followed her into her bedroom. She kicked off her slippers and got back into bed, sat up looking at him with sleepweighted eyes.</p>

    <p>"Dont talk too loud on account of Martin."</p>

    <p>"Ellie I dont know why it's always so difficult for me to speak out about anything. . . . I always have to get drunk to speak out. . . . Look here do you like me any more?"</p>

    <p>"You know I'm awfully fond of you and always shall be."</p>

    <p>"I mean love, you know what I mean, whatever it is . . ." he broke in harshly.</p>

    <p>"I guess I dont love anybody for long unless they're dead. . . . I'm a terrible sort of person. It's no use talking about it."</p>

    <p>"I knew it. You knew I knew it. O God things are pretty rotten for me Ellie."</p>

    <p>She sat with her knees hunched up and her hands clasped round them looking at him with wide eyes. "Are you really so crazy about me 
        <person key="JimmyHerf">

            </persName>
        </person>?"</p>

    <p>"Look here lets get a divorce and be done with it."</p>

    <p>"Dont be in such a hurry, 
        <person key="JimmyHerf">

                <addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName>
            </persName>
        </person>. . . . And there's Martin. What about him?"</p>

    <p>"I can scrape up enough money for him occasionally, poor little kid."</p>

    <p>"I make more than you do, 
        <person key="JimmyHerf">
            <persName>
                <addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName>
            </persName>
        </person>. . . . You shouldnt do that yet."</p>

    <p>"I know. I know. Dont I know it?"</p>

    <p>They sat looking at each other without speaking. Their eyes burned from looking at each other. Suddenly 
        <person key="JimmyHerf">
        <persName>
            <forename>Jimmy</forename>
        </persName>
        </person> wanted terribly to be asleep, not to remember anything, to let his head sink into blackness, as into his mother's lap when he was a kid.</p>

    <p>"Well I'm going home." He gave a little dry laugh. "We didn't think it'd all go pop like this, did we?"</p>

    <p>"Goodnight 
        <person key="JimmyHerf">
            <persName>
                <addName type="nickname">Jimps</addName>
            </persName>
        </person>," she whined in the middle of a yawn.</p>

    <p>"But things dont end. . . . If only I weren' so terribly sleepy. . . . Will you put out the light?"</p>

    <p>He groped his way in the dark to the door. Outside the arctic morning was growing gray with dawn. He hurried back to his room. He wanted to get into bed and be asleep before it was light.</p>

    <p>A long low room with long tables down the middle piled with silk and crêpe fabrics, brown, salmonpink, emeraldgreen. A smell of snipped thread and dress materials. All down the tables bowed heads auburn, blond, black, brown of girls sewing. Errandboys pushing rolling stands of hung dresses up and down the aisles. A bell rings and the room breaks out with noise and talk shrill as a birdhouse.</p>

    <p>Anna gets up and stretches out her arms. "My I've got a head," she says to the girl next her.</p>

    <p>"Up last night?"</p>

    <p>She nods.</p>

    <p>"Ought to quit it dearie, it'll spoil your looks. A girl cant burn the candle at both ends like a feller can." The other girl is thin and blond and has a crooked nose. She puts her arm round Anna's waist. "My I wish I could put on a little of your weight."</p>

    <p>"I wish you could," says Anna. "Dont matter what I eat it turns to fat."</p>

    <p>"Still you aint too fat. . . . You're juss plump so's they like to squeeze ye. You try wearing boyishform like I told an you'll look fine."</p>

    <p>"My boyfriend says he likes a girl to have shape."</p>

    <p>On the stairs they push their way through a group of girls listening to a little girl with red hair who talks fast, opening her mouth wide and rolling her eyes. ". . . She lived just on the next block at 2230 Cameron Avenue an she'd been to the Hippodrome with some girlfriends and when they got home it was late an they let her go home alone, up Cameron Avenue, see? An the next morning when her folks began looking for her they found her behind a Spearmint sign in a back lot."</p>

    <p>"Was she dead?"</p>

    <p>"Sure she was. . . . A negro had done somethin terrible to her and then he'd strangled her. . . . I felt terrible. I used to go to school with her. An there aint a girl on Cameron Avenue been out after dark they're so scared."</p>

    <p>"Sure I saw all about it in the paper last night. Imagine livin right on the next block."</p>

    <p>'Did you see me touch that hump back?" cried Rosie as he settled down beside her in the taxi. "In the lobby of the theater?" He pulled at the trousers that were tight over his knees. "That's goin to give us luck Jake. I never seen a hump back to fail. . . . if you touch him on the hump . . . Ou it makes me sick how fast these taxis go." They were thrown forward by the taxi's sudden stop. "My God we almost ran over a boy." Jake Silverman patted her knee. "Poor ikle kid, was it all worked up?" As they drove up to the hotel she shivered and buried her face in her coatcollar. When they went to the desk to get the key, the clerk said to Silverman, "There's a gentleman waiting to see you sir." A thickset man came up to him taking a cigar out of his mouth. "Will you step this way a minute please Mr. Silverman." Rosie thought she was going to faint. She stood perfectly stilly frozen, with her cheeks deep in the fur collar of her coat.</p>

    <p>They sat in two deep armchairs and whispered with their heads together. Step by step, she got nearer, listening. "Warrant . . . Department of Justice . . . using the mails to defraud . . ." She couldnt hear what Jake said in between. He kept nodding his head as if agreeing. Then suddenly he spoke out smoothly, smiling.</p>

    <p>"Well I've heard your side Mr. Rogers. . . . Here's mine. If you arrest me now I shall be ruined and a great many people who have put their money in this enterprise will be ruined. . . . In a week I can liquidate the whole concern with a profit. . . . Mr. Rogers I am a man who has been deeply wronged through foolishness in misplacing confidence in others."</p>

    <p>"I cant help that. . . . My duty is to execute the warrant. . . . I'm afraid I'll have to search your room. . . . You see we have several little items . . ." The man flicked the ash off his cigar and began to read in a monotonous voice. "Jacob Silverman, alias Edward Faversham, Simeon J. Arbuthnot, Jack Hinkley, J. J. Gold. . . . Oh we've got a pretty little list. . . . We've done some very pretty work on your case, if I do say it what shouldnt."</p>



    <p>They got to their feet. The man with the cigar jerked his head at a lean man in a cap who sat reading a paper on the opposite side of the lobby.</p>

    <p>Silverman walked over to the desk. "I'm called away on business," he said to the clerk. "Will you please have my bill prepared? Mrs. Silverman will keep the room for a few days."</p>

    <p>Rosie couldnt speak. She followed the three men into the elevator. "Sorry to have to do this maam," said the lean detective pulling at the visor of his cap. Silverman opened the room door for them and closed it carefully behind him.</p>

    <p>"Thank you for your consideration, gentlemen. . . . My wife thanks you." Rosie sat in a straight chair in the corner of the room. She was biting her tongue hard, harder to try to keep her lips from twitching.</p>

    <p>"We realize Mr. Silverman that this is not quite the ordinary criminal case."</p>

    <p>"Wont you have a drink gentlemen?"</p>

    <p>They shook their heads. The thickset man was lighting a fresh cigar.</p>

    <p>"Allright Mike," he said to the lean man. "Go through the drawers and closet."</p>

    <p>"Is that regular?"</p>

    <p>"If this was regular we'd have the handcuffs on you and be running the lady here as an accessory."</p>

    <p>Rosie sat with her icy hands clasped between her knees swaying her body from side to side. Her eyes were closed. While the detectives were rummaging in the closet, Silverman took the opportunity to put his hand on her shoulder. She opened her eyes. "The minute the goddam dicks take me out phone Schatz and tell him everything. Get hold of him if you have to wake up everybody in New York." He spoke low and fast, his lips barely moving.</p>

    <p>Almost immediately he was gone, followed by the two detectives with a satchel full of letters. His kiss was still wet on her lips. She looked dazedly round the empty deathly quiet room. She noticed some writing on the lavender blotter on the desk. It was his handwriting, very scrawly: Hock everything and beat it; you are a good kid. Tears began running down her cheeks. She sat a long while with her head dropped on the desk kissing the penciled words on the blotter.</p>
